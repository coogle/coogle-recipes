      <step>  "Weekend All Things Considered"; so here for the world:
  
  Note: Feel free to vary the quantities and ingredients of this recipe to
  suit your taste. As Bati Restaurant makes it, the salad is slightly spicy,
  but not too hot, with a definite, but not puckering, vinegar flavor.
  
  Preheat oven to 450 degrees
  
  Roast peppers on a baking sheet until they soften and blister enough so you
  can peel them. Put them a brown paper bag or covered pot until they're cool
  enough to handle; then peel, remove any stems and seeds, and coarsely chop
  so each chunk is about one to two inches square. Coarsely chop the tomatoes
  and add to the peppers.
  
  Coarsely chop the garlic, then grind with salt using a mortar and pestle or
  any makeshift tool, until the mixture has turned to paste. Whisk into the
  vinegar.
  
  Whisk the olive oil into the vinegar-garlic mixture, toss with the peppers
  and tomatoes ... and enjoy! Tarik likes to let the salad sit for a couple
  hours before serving and then he spoons yoghurt sprinkled with raw minced
  garlic on top. Goktan, on the other hand, likes to eat his roast pepper
  salad the moment it's done...dunking big chunks of crusty bread into the
  vinaigrette as he does so....
