      <step>  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Generously butter a shallow six cup casserole
  or a large long shallow pan. Line pan with one layer of bread slices. Heat
  the heavy cream over moderately low heat until hot but not simmering. Beat
  the eggs with the sugar until well combined. Slowly add scalded cream and
  beat until mixture thickens. Pour custard mixture over bread slices. Set
  casserole in a pan of hot water and bake for 45 minutes. Edges should be
  set and the center should be a bit runny. (The custard will continue to
  cook after it's removed from the oven.) Remove casserole from water bath
  and cool on rack. Serve at room temperature or chilled. Serves 8.
