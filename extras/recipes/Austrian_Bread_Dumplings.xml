      <step>  1 Tbsp     chopped fresh herbs (parsley, chervil, marjoram) - optional, but
  a great improvement
  
  You will need a frying pan, a large and a small bowl, and a saucepan of
  water or soup.  Fry the diced bread lightly in the fat in a frying pan.
  Meanwhile, mix the egg and the milk in a small bowl. Tip the contents of
  the frying pan into a large bowl, and pour the egg and milk over all. Stir
  in the flour, and season with salt and pepper. Add the herbs, if using. You
  may need more milk to make a soft dough. Allow it to stand for 1/2 an hour.
  
  Dip your hand into cold water and roll the mixture into a dozen small
  balls.  Put a pot of salted water on to boil, if there isn't a simmering
  soup pot waiting. Drop little balls of dough into the boiling salted water
  or the soup.  Poach them for 10 to 15 minutes, until they are light and
  firm and well risen.
  
  Yield:  12 dumplings Time: 1 hour
  
  Notes:  You may include chopped fried bacon or cubed pork cracklings in the
  mixture.  Leaving out flour will result in a lighter dumpling.
