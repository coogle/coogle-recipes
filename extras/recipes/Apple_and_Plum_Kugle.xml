  My grandmother used to make this incredible Apple Kugl for Rosh Hashana.
  She is 91 years old, and this year she is very sick, so for the first time
  since I was born, she won't be able to cook for us in the Holidays. She
  taught me how to bake this kugl, I hope everybody enjoys it the way our
  family did for many, many years. I 'd like to share it with all of you as a
  tribute to such a great woman, who came to Mexico a few days before all her
  family was murdered in Lithuania.
  
  Mix the ingredients and form a soft dough. (if you use a Food Procesor, mix
  the dry ingredients first, and then slowly add the liquids). Finish the
  dough kneadding it with your hands for a few minutes. Extend the dough with
  the rolling pin in a big circular shape (aprox. 18 in diameter). Spread the
  circle with plum preserve (maybe 1 or 1 1/2 jars). until it is very well
  covered.  Peel 4 apples and slice them (not very thin, you may use 2 or 3
  more apples depending on their size). Put the apples over the preserves,
  sprinkle with sugar, cinamon and a little bit of pepper. Roll the strudl
  very carefully, making a tight roll. Seal the edges with water. Have ready
  a deep ovenproof large pot, with boiling oil. (about 2/3 cup). Very
  carefully place the kugl in the oil rolling it (to make it fit in the pot).
  Cover the kugl with boiling water. (yes, water, it won't mess up the
  dough). Then cover the pot with foil, and put it in the oven for 2 hours at
  400 degrees. Uncover the pot and let it brown a little. Serving: Unmold the
  kugl, and slice it like a cake. Don't worry the slices won't come out
  perfect, but the flavor will.
  
  It sounds difficult, but it's not, and it's worthwhile. I hope everybody
  tries before Rosh Hashana so you'll be a pro for the Holydays.
