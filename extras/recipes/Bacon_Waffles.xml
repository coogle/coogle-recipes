      <step>    I am sure that you have tried these before, but just in case I shall
  suggest a favorite of my sons, Channing and Jason.
  
    Fry the bacon first and then place a slice or two on top of the batter
  when you put it in the iron. The boys think I thought that up . . . and I
  have never had the nerve to tell them the truth.
