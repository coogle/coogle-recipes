      <step>  YIELD: About 48 biscotti DIFFICULTY: * PREPARATION: 30 minutes plus baking
  and cooling times Recipe From: Chocolatier Magazine
  
  Note: To lightly roast almonds, position a rack in the center of the oven
  and preheat to 350 degrees F. Spread the nuts in a single layer on a baking
  sheet. Roast for 10 to 15 minutes, shaking the pan 2 or 3 times during
  roasting, until the nuts are beginning to color. Transfer the nuts to
  another baking sheet to stop the cooking process and cool completely. Using
  a large, sharp knife, cut the nuts into halves.
  
  1. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F.
  Lightly butter and flour an "insulated" cookie sheet.
  
  2. Using a large, sharp knife, finely chop the chocolate. (Do not use a
  food processor, it will chop the chocolate too fine.) Scrape the chocolate
  into a small bowl or cup.
  
  3. In a food processor, using the metal chopping blade, combine the flour,
  sugar, baking powder, and salt. Process in on/off pulses until blended. Add
  the almond paste and butter. Process in on/off pulses until the mixture
  forms coarse crumbs.
  
  4. Scrape the flour mixture into a large bowl. Using a rubber spatula stir
  in the almonds, pistachio nuts and chocolate.
  
  5. Break the whole eggs into a measuring cup with a pouring spout. Add the
  egg yolk and beat with a fork, until blended. Remove 2 teaspoons of the egg
  mixture and set aside in a small cup to use later as egg wash. Add the
  vanilla to the egg mixture in the measuring cup and stir until blended.
  
  6. Make a well in the center of the flour/nut mixture. Add the beaten
  egg/vanilla mixture and using a rubber spatula, stir until the mixture
  starts to clump together. Using your hands, form the mixture into a ball.
  
  7. Scrape the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and with your
  hands pat the ball into an 8-inch disk. Cut the disk into 4 equal wedges.
  
  8. With lightly floured hands, gently roll each quarter into a 12-inch log.
  Carefully place the logs on the prepared cookie sheet at least 2 inches
  apart. Flatten slightly with the heel of your hand to the width of 1 1/4
  inches. Lightly brush the logs with the reserved egg wash.
  
  9. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, until the logs start to brown and bounce back
  when gently pressed with a finger. Set the cookie sheet on a wire rack and
  cool the logs for 20 minutes.
  
  10. Position one rack in the top third and another rack in the bottom
  third; reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F.
  
  11. With a long metal cake spatula, carefully transfer the logs to a
  cutting surface. Using a sharp, finely serrated knife, cut the logs on the
  diagonal into 1/2-inch thick slices. Place the biscotti standing up, 1/2
  inch apart on two ungreased "insulated" cookie sheets.
  
  12. Bake an additional 15 to 25 minutes, until the biscotti are dry and the
  sides begin to color slightly. Halfway through baking, switch the positions
  of the cookie sheets for even browning. Do not overbake.
  
  13. Cool the biscotti on the cookie sheets for 5 minutes. Transfer to wire
  racks and cool completely. Store the biscotti in an airtight tin in a cool,
  dry place for up to two weeks.
