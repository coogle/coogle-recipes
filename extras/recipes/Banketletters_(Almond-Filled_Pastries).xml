      <step>  The confectioners of The Netherlands rank among the finest in Europe, so
  don’t get frustrated if you need to try this recipe two or three times to
  master your preparation. These little almond-based confections are
  immensely popular for the holidays in The Netherlands.
  
  Banketletters are flaky, puffed pastries filled with a delectable almond
  paste and shaped into a letter, usually an initial. One of the most popular
  letters is “M”-- for Mother. “M” also happens to be one of the larger
  letters to select and serve. No Sinterklaas Eve gathering would be complete
  without a large pastry letter adorning the serving table.
  
  In a large bowl cut butter into small pieces and add to flour. Utilize a
  pastry blender or 2 knives and cut the butter into the flour until the
  butter is the size of peas. In a separate bowl, mix sour cream with the egg
  yolk and blend into the flour and butter mixture with a fork until the
  dough forms a ball. Divide the dough into 2 pieces, wrap well and
  refrigerate for several hours (or several days, if desired). Allow dough to
  return to room temperature before preparing cookies.
  
  If you are preparing your own almond filling, grind the almonds well and
  mix with the sugar and almond extract in a bowl. Add the egg and use a
  wooden spoon or you hands to work the mixture until it is smooth. Almond
  paste will keep for several weeks when wrapped securely and refrigerated.
  
  To prepare the cookies roll the room temperature dough out into 1/2-inch
  thickness and cut dough into strips 3 1/2 to 4-inches long. Work the almond
  filling into little round sticks about the length and diameter of your
  finger. Lay the almond paste sticks on the dough strips individually. Place
  a dab of cold water on the end of each dough stick with almond filling and
  tuck under. Make sure to place cookies seam-side-down on a cookie sheet.
  
  Sticks may be formed into letters or wreaths, or any shape you desire.
  Parts of letters can be joined by adding a dab of water to the joint of the
  cookie. Prior to baking brush each cookie with 1 egg that has been beaten
  with 1 Tbs. of water. Bake cookies in a pre-heated 400-F degree oven for 20
  to 25 -minutes or until golden brown. Cool on wire rack. Cookies may be
  served warm, if desired. Refrigerate to store and serve at room
  temperature.
