  "When I was a student at the University of Missouri, I spent a semester
  working in a preschool. That's where I discovered Aggression Cookies, a
  not-so-unique cookie with a unique name. These cookies, I discovered, offer
  a socially acceptable way for youngsters to let off steam and to make a
  tasty snack at the same time. The dough is stiff, so children can mash,
  knead, squeeze and pound it to their hearts' content without inflicting any
  damage. Children don't need to know the name of these cookies; just tell
  them you've got a special cookie for them to make."
  
  Combine brown sugar, butter, oats, baking soda and flour in a large mixing
  bowl. Mash, knead, squeeze and pound ingredients to make a dough.
  
  Form dough into small balls. Put balls on ungreased baking sheets. Grease
  the bottom of a small glass or jar; dip into granulated sugar and use to
  flatten balls.
  
  Bake in a preheated 350 deg oven about 15 minutes or until done. Transfer
  to racks to cool. Makes about 7 dozen cookies.
