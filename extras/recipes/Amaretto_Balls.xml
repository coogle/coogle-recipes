    <directions>
      <step>  Process pecans and wafers separately; combine in food processor with sugar.
  SLOWLY pour in liqueur until mixture forms a ball. You might not need the
  whole amount, depending on the humidity level. (If mixture gets too wet,
  put it in the refrigerator -- uncovered -- overnight to dry out some.)
  
  Shape into small balls; roll in additional finely chopped pecans. Store in
  tightly sealed container. Yield: Not nearly enough.
  
  Vicki's notes:
  
  *  One Christmas Eve I had to work, but I took a break to pop in a
  bookstore.  They were having an open house, and I managed to snarf a lot of
  these morsels during those stolen minutes! After Christmas I came back to
  hunt down the clerk who brought these -- my finest bit of sleuthing yet...
  
  *  These are equally enjoyed and requested by my friends. Although some
  have tried other liqueurs -- including bourbon -- the results are never as
  good as the original!
  
  *  I substitute Oreos for the wafers, plus use only 1 1/3 C confec sugar;
  don't worry about the cookies' filling because it is nothing more than
  confec sugar.
