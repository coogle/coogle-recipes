    <directions>
      <step>  THE PLAN: This creamy soup has a tart onion base made of apple, onion and
  celery. It needs to be stewed long enough to soften the vegetables so that
  the puree will be very smooth. While it stews, peel and cube the potatoes;
  boil and drain them. Heat the broth and cook the shrimp; chop and season
  the shrimp. About 30 minutes before serving, assemble and reheat the soup.
  You could make the parts of the soup ahead and store in the refrigerator;
  allow time to return the ingredients to room temperature before assembling.
  The shrimp will toughen on reheat. NOTE: If you want a silkier base, strain
  the puree.
  
  (30 mins) Finely chop a cored and peeled apple; a peeled and trimmed onion
  or two, and a celery stalk without leaves. If the celery is stringy, remove
  strings with a peeler. Melt the butter in a deep skillet, sautepan, or wok
  and saute the apple, celery, and onions until wilted and starting to color;
  about 5 to 8 minutes (the finer the chop, the longer it will take). Add the
  wine and swirl the pan to distribute. Then add the water and the apple
  juice concentrate; bring to a simmer. Stew until almost all the water has
  evaporated and the vegetables are very soft, about 10 to 12 minutes. Let
  cool a few minutes then puree the mixture in a food processor (or blender)
  until very smooth. Add the ricotta, some of the milk and all the NFDM
  flakes (or powder) and puree as smooth as possible. Return to the pan and
  stir in the remaining milk.
  
  (20 mins) Stir or whisk into the soup base curry powder, celery seed (or
  salt) and pepper. Simmer over very low heat, whisking regularly, until
  reduced and thickened, about 10 minutes. Add the broth used to cook the
  shrimp, pouring it through a fine mesh strainer. Mix thoroughly then add
  the potatoes and simmer for about 4 minutes until the potatoes are hot.
  Finally stir in the shrimp and tarragon, and simmer for a few minutes. Do
  not over cook the shrimp. Taste: add cardamom if you want to boost the
  apple flavor. Serve at once in a wide and shallow bowl to show off the
  color of the shrimp.
  
  POTATOES: (12-15 mins), cover the diced potatoes with water and bring to a
  boil. Boil slowly for 5-8 minutes, then drain.
  
  SHRIMP (10-12 mins): If frozen, let stand in cold water no more than 2
  minutes. Drain and pat dry. Heat* the vegetable broth seasoned with old bay
  just to boiling. Add the shrimp and let stand until just pink. Remove from
  the broth. Remove the tails and put the tails back in the broth for
  additional flavor. Quarter the shrimp: slice in half along it's length then
  cut into bite-sized pieces about the same bulk. Toss the shrimp with the
  chopped fresh tarragon (to taste) and additional bay seasoning (to aroma).
  *(stove top or microwave)

  Lee's Intro: The shrimp dish that inspired this curried soup was always
  served over rice. Variations: substitute rice for the potatoes. Add fresh
  corn off the cob. &gt;from Lee Bailey's Soup Meals (1989:isbn0517573040)
