      <step>  Servings: 6 to 8 Notes: Angu (pronounced "aing goo") is a sort of polenta,
  one of the many cooked starch pastes one finds in Brazil. For best results,
  use a fine, stone ground cornmeal.
  
  DIRECTIONS: Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Cook the garlic and onion
  over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes or until soft but not brown. Add 2 cups
  water and bring to a rapid boil.
  
  Add the cornmeal in a thin stream through your fingers, stirring vigorously
  to prevent lumps. The mixture should be the consistency of choux pastry or
  soft ice cream. If too thick, make a hole in the angu with a wooden spoon
  and stir in a little cold water. Reduce the heat to low and gently simmer
  for 3 to 4 minutes. Correct the seasoning and serve at once.
  
  Note: For a prettier presentation, the angu can be spooned into a thickly
  buttered tube pan and unmolded onto a platter. (Picture in magazine shows
  that a fluted tube pan was used, and the center of the unmolded angu was
  filled with flat leaf parsley- or cilantro?
