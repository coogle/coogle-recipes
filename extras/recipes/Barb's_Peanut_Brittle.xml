      <step>  This recipe takes quite a lot of counter space.  Start by taking four
  cookie sheets and buttering them. Around each cookie sheet, spread aluminum
  foil (need about 4 square feet around each cookie sheet).
  
  In a heavy bottomed sauce pan, add the sugar, water, and corn syrup.  Make
  sure not to get any on the sides of the pan.  Heat on low until everything
  becomes liquid, then turn heat up to medium.  Insert candy thermometer, and
  boil mixture until it reaches 240 degrees F.  Slowly, add the peanuts.  The
  mixture should NOT stop boiling.  Continue heating until the mixture
  reaches
      310    degrees F.
  
  Remove the pan from the stove.  Toss in the cube of butter.  Mix the soda,
  salt and vanilla, and pour them into the mixture.  Mix it all up using a
  wooden spoon.
  
  Pour the mixture onto the 4 buttered cookie sheets.  Get you fingers REAL
  buttery.  As the peanut brittle cools along the edges, pull it out into
  thin strings. It usually takes two people to keep up with it.
  
  As soon as everything has cooled down, store the Peanut brittle in a sealed
  container.  It is very hydrophillic and will stick together if you let it
  sit out.
