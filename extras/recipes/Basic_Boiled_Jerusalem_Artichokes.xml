      <step>  1.  Wash and gently scrub the artichokes under cook, running water. If they
  have just come out of the refrigerator, let them until they warm to room
  temperature, about an hour.
  
  2.  Put just enough cold water to cover the artichokes in a kettle that
  will comfortably hold them.  Turn on the heat to medium-high and bring the
  water to a boil.
  
  3.  Throw in a small handful of salt and add the artichokes. Let the water
  return to biling and reduce the heat to medium. Simmer, uncovered, until
  they are to the level of tenderness that the individual recipe requires. To
  eath them plain or in salads, they should be just tender and may take as
  little as 10 minutes ; for creamed, or mashed, artichokes, they should be
  as soft as boiled potatoes and may take as long as half an hour.
  
  4.  Drain them well and serve warm with lots of melted butter following a
  recipe for mashed potatoes.
