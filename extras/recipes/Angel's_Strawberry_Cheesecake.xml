    <directions>
      <step>  Put curd cheese into a mixing bowl and soften with wooden spoon. Sift in
  icing sugar and work in thoroughly. Stir in grated lemon rind. Whisk cream
  until fairly stiff and fold thoroughly into cheese. Pile mixture in middle
  of serving plated and, using a spatula, mould and smooth into a round shape
  about 6 inches in diameter. Smooth the top level. Chill in fridge for at
  least one hour. Shortly before serving spoon redcurrant jelly into saucepan
  and stir around to break up. Stir in lemon juice and pepper and put over
  low to medium heat, stirring constantly until smooth. Remove from heat.
  Take cheese base from fridge and arrange strawberries on top. Spoon
  redcurrant glaze over them and leave in a cool place until ready to serve.

  NOTES : By Brian St. Pierre, Sunday pudding no. 80
       Not a real cheesecake at all, this is just a mixture of sweetened
       curd cheese
       and cram which forms a base for glazed strawberries. An easy but
       delicious
       pudding.
