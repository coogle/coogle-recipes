      <step>  Cut the onions in half crosswise, pull of the skins, and scoop out the
  centers. leaving sturdy shells. Chop the scooped-out onion. Combine the
  beef, egg, salt, 3/4 cup of sauce and the chopped onion. Blend well and
  shape into 6 large meatballs.  Cut 6 squares of heavy duty foil, large
  enough to contain each onion half, and on each of the squares. Put a
  meatball in each onion half and spoon a little of the sauce over the
  combination.  Fold the foil up around the onions and seal tightly, allowing
  space in the foil packets for steam. Grill 4 to 6 inches above the hot
  coals about 30 minutes. Protecting the hands with mitts, peel back the foil
  so tops of the meat and onions are exposed. Baste with the drippings in the
  foil packets or with additional sauce. Cover the grill or shape a loose
  tent of foil over the onions and continue cooking 25 minutes longer or
  until the onions are as tender as desired and the meat is done to your
  taste.
