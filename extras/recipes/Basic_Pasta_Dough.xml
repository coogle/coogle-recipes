      <step>  to make about 1 1/2 pounds of pasta-(From the Good Cook Pasta
  book-Time-Life series)
  
  Mound 3 cups of flour on smooth work surface-make a well in the center of
  the mound and break the eggs into the well. Add a big pinch of salt and the
  olive oil. Slowly mix in the flour with the eggs by using the flour just
  around the eggs without breaking down the sides of the well until enough
  flour has been incorporated into the eggs to hold it all together. When all
  the flour has been incorporated and the dough still feels sticky add more
  flour, just a little bit at a time. The dough should feel stiff, but
  malleable. I have also put the ingredients into a food processor and the
  dough comes out just fine. The dough then can be kneaded by hand briefly
  before either rolling out by hand or with a pasta machine. Wrap the pasta
  in plastic wrap and let rest for about an hour. After the pasta has rested
  roll/cut to desired size/shape and let dry on pasta rack or a broomstick
  or........until brittle. The pasta can also be cooked directly without
  being dried. If it is cooked before it is dried it takes very little time
  to cook-
