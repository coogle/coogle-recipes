    I owe this dish to a friend, Brian. He will put anything in his barbecue
  except the neighbor's dog. He can eat three meals a day out of his cooker,
  so I was anxious to respond to his dinner invitation. This recipe was
  particularly unusual and delicious. It is just too simple to believe.
  
    Bake the potatoes in their skins about 30 minutes at 450Ã¸, or until they
  are just slightly tender. Do not fully cook them as they must be sliced.
  While still a bit hot, cut the potatoes lengthwise in half and then each
  half into quarters. Place the pieces in a glass baking dish and cover with
  the dressing. Let stand 1 hour, turning once. Remove from the dressing and
  place on the grill. Salt and pepper to taste and grill the pieces until
  golden brown, about
       10    minutes on each side.
