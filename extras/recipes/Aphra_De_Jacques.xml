      <step>  Slice cheese into 30 slices about 1/4 inch thick.  Peel garlic and slice
  each clove lengthwise into about 6 ovals.  Heat oil in deep, heavy
  saucepan over medium-low heat.  Add garlic ovals and simmer 5 to 7
  minutes, being careful not to burn or brown cloves.  Remove slices as they
  float to the surface and are light brown in color.  Drain on paper towel.
  Reserve oil for cheese.  Mince garlic and mix with Italian seasoning.
  Spread half the cheese slices evenly with garlic mixture.  Press remaining
  cheese slices on each of make 15 bars.  Dip flour-coated pieces into egg
  again, then into bread crumbs mixed with parsley.  Be sure to cover sides.
   Reheat oil to medium-high and fry cheese in oil a few pieces at a time
  until lightly browned (takes about 2 minutes).  Skim particles from oil as
  they accumulate.  Drain cheese on paper towels and keep warm until all are
  fried.  Serve with toothpicks and Marinara Sauce for dipping.  Makes about
       30    pieces.
