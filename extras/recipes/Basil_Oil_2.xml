    <directions>
      <step>  Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil. Blanch the basil leaves
  for 15 seconds, immediately transfer to a bowl of iced water and drain.
  Coarsely chop the basil, squeezing out
  
  any excess water between paper towels. In a blender combine the chopped
  basil and oil and puree for 3 to 4 minutes or until bright green. Pour into
  a jar or other air tight container, cover, and refrigerate for 1 day.
  Strain the oil through cheesecloth and refrigerate for another 24 hours.
  Bring oil to room temperature to use.
  
  Yield: about 2 cups
