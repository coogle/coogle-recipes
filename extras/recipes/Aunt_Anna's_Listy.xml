      <step>  Source: Roberta Brisson - This recipe is from my dad's sister. It's also a
  very old recipe.
  
  Mix eggs, salt, flour and whiskey to make a stiff dough working it into a
  smooth dough. On a lightly floured board, roll dough very thin (almost
  paper thin). Cut into the size of a 3-inch square and make 2 slits in the
  center with a sharpe knife. This is a very stiff and sticky dough.
  
  Deep fry in lard (350 degrees) for 2 to 3 seconds. Fry only a couple at a
  time. Remove from fat and drain on paper toweling. Dust generously with
  confectioners' sugar when cooled.
  
  NOTE: This is the only recipe I don't substitute the lard. It gives the
  pastry a better taste that oil. My father also said that these were like
  eating air. (Too bad that they don't have the calories of air.) It was one
  of his favorites.
