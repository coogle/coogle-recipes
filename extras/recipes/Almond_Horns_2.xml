      <step>  (*) To blanch almonds, dip almonds into boiling water for 1 minute. Remove
  the brown skin covering. Dry in a 200°F oven for 30-45 minutes, stirring
  occasionally. Use a food processor to chop them to the finest size
  possible. (A 2-pound bag of almonds is what you'll need for this recipe).
  
  Preheat oven to 300°F. Combine all of the ingredients thoroughly. Form into
  desired shapes and sizes (we usually form them into crescents) and bake on
  greased and floured cookie sheets. Bake for 20-30 minutes depending on
  thickness of cookie. (In my oven, it takes about 24 minutes).
  
  NOTES : This recipe is a double recipe.  These are one of my favorite
  cookies--I just LOVE almonds!
