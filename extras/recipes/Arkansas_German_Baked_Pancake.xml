  From: Jim Porter &lt;jporter@pbsj.com&gt;
  Here is a breakfast dish that was in Southern Living magazine this spring,
  published from /The Dairy Hollow House Cookbook/.  I originally (before
  finding this list) made it according to the recipe -- not fat-free.  For
  this past Sunday's breakfast I trimmed it back, and it came out just as
  well.  I thought you might enjoy it too.
  
  This is basically a big, puffy pancake that you cover with sauteed apples
  and slice into wedges.  For the apple filling, I just modified the
  (microwave) "sauteed" apples recipe posted in the archives (courtesy Asha
  Dornfest), instead of sauteeing with 1/4 c of butter.
  
  (Spray "skillet" with cooking spray.)
  
  HEAT a 12-inch cast-iron skillet in a 450 degree oven for 5 mins. (I just
  used my chili pot, with the plastic handles removed. You'll want something
  a little deep, as this pancake puffs-up when cooking)
  
  COMBINE first 3 ingredients in a mixing bowl; beat at medium speed with
  electric mixer until  smooth.  Add flour and salt; beat 5 mins.
  
  POUR batter into hot skillet.  Bake at 450 for 15 mins.; reduce heat to
  350, and bake 8 mins., or until puffed and browned. Remove from oven; spoon
  Apple Filling over pancake (pancake will deflate). Sprinkle with powdered
  sugar. Cut into wedges, and serve immediately. Yield 4 servings.
  
  APPLE FILLING: Place apples in microwavable container with a squeeze of
  lemon juice and a sprinkling of cinnamon (and Butter Buds, if you like).
  Cook on high for 4 minutes, or more -- till desired tenderness (I cook it
  longer (double?, stirring after half the time), as I like them tender.
  Remove from microwave; stir in honey, and let sit till you are ready to
  use.
