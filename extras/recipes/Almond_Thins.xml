      <step>  Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
  
  Cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla
  and beat until smooth.
  
  Sift together the flour and salt and slowly add to butter mixture. Mix
  until just blended.
  
  Divide batter in half and place each half on in the center of two
  ungreased, flat-sided cookie sheets.
  
  Dip a spatula in warm water and spread batter to cover the entire baking
  sheet, making sure batter is spread evenly. Sprinkle almonds and press
  gently into dough.
  
  Bake each sheet about 12 minutes, or until edges are lightly browned.
  Remove from oven.
  
  Cut hot cookies into neat 2-inch squares. Return to oven and bake until
  lightly golden... about 5 minutes. Watch carefully to prevent overbaking.
  
  Remove from oven to a wire rack. Slide spatula under cookies to loosen.
  Cool completely on cookie sheets. Store in airtight containers with layers
  of wax paper between layers.
  
  Makes 6 dozen
  
  Notes: Thin and delicate, these are perfect for everything from formal
  parties to your morning coffee.
