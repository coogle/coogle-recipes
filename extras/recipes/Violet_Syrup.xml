    <directions>
      <step>  Select only the freshest and most unblemished violets in your garden. Place
  violet petal in a deep bowl and pour the boiling water over them. Weigh
  down with a heavy dish to keep them submerged. Place the bowl in a
  draft-free place at room temperature for 24 hours. Line a colander with
  layers of rinsed cheesecloth and place over a bowl. Pour violets and liquid
  into colander, squeezing out juice from the violets; discard the violets.
  Place sugar, lemon juice and water in a saucepan and boil into a very thick
  syrup, near the candy stage. Add violet water and bring to a rolling boil.
  Boil 10 minutes or until thickened. Pour into sterile bottles. Allow to
  cool, then seal and refrigerate. Serve with ice water or club soda.
  VARIATION: Substitute 4 cups fragrant rose petals and add 1 cinnamon stick
  per bottle of syrup. MAKES: 2 QUARTS
