      <step>  TIP: About 1 quart of water is needed, more or less. You can enhance
  flavors by using chicken or vegetable broth; or try a garlic stock (see
  separate recipe).
  
  Cut away the top leaves of the artichokes and break off the bottom leaves.
  Trim the bottoms and rub with the cut side of a lemon. Cut small artichokes
  in half, larger artichokes into quarters, and remove the spiny fibers with
  a sharp knife. Rub the cut edges with a cut lemon and set aside.
  
  Heat the olive oil in a lidded large heavy-bottomed saucepan or casserole
  over medium-low heat and add the onions. Saute, stirring, until tender,
  about 8 minutes. Add half the garlic and cook, stirring, until the garlic
  begins to color, about 1 minute. Add the artichokes, the juice of 1/2
  lemon, water or stock to cover, the bay leaf, salt, and pepper. Bring to a
  simmer, cover, and simmer over low heat for 30 minutes.
  
  Add the potatoes, remaining garlic, remaining lemon juice, thyme, and
  parsley. Make sure the liquid covers everything (add as needed), cover, and
  simmer for another 30 minutes or until the potatoes are tender. Adjust the
  seasonings and serve.
  
  ADVANCE PREP: This can be made several hours before serving and reheated.

  "This wonderfully, lemony, warming, long-simmering dish is substantial
  enough to eat as a main course." You can use 2 or 3 small purple artichokes
  per serving ..." that you see all over Provence or big California
  artichokes cut into quarters. They work just as well, absorbing the
  succulent broth in the most delicious way."-MRS
