      <step>  Preheat oven to 425F degrees. Grease 2 cookie sheets or coat with vegetable
  cooking spray.
  
  Mix cornmeal and salt in a bowl and pour in boiling water, stirring all the
  while to keep lumps from forming. Stir in margarine.
  
  Drop 1 tablespoon at the time onto the cookie sheets. This batter should be
  liquid enough to spread out into a 3-inch circle. If it doesn't spread, add
  a bit more water. Bake until golden brown around the edges and crispy,
  about 20 minutes. Serve with sweet butter.
  
  Makes approximately 36 wafers.

  Notes: Look like a cornmeal cookie. Lee's Intro: These wonderful, crisp
  little wafers are so easy to prepare you will want to make them every time
  you serve soup. You might vary them by adding a bit of prepared Cajun
  seasoning to the batter.
