  I went to the Library this week and borrowed this book: More Top Secret
  Recipes by Todd Wilbur...I'm going to type as many of the recipes as time
  permits before having to return it. Take care and have a great weekend!!!
  
  1.  Dissolve the sugar in the hot water. 2. Add the root beer concentrate
  and let cool. 3. Combine the root beer mixture with the cold seltzer water,
  drink immediately, or store in fridge in tightly covered container.
  
  The root beer you'll make here is a simplified version of Roy Allen's
  method from the early 1900's.  Instead of harvesting roots, herbs, and
  berries, you have the luxury of using a root beer concentrate that can be
  found in most grocery stores. In 1922 Allen expanded his business, he
  formed a partnership with entrepreneur Frank Wright. This led to the name
  that would become famous, A&amp;W, the country's best-selling root beer.
