  This is my faithful large crowd rice recipe - I made it last week for the
  Pidun Haben of our Rabbi's grandson (for 150 people - they invited the
  whole shul) and it took about 10 minutes to set up (I went home changed
  clothing ran an errand and came back and it was perfect).
  
  BTW does anyone know why garlic cloves (raw) and sugar cubes are handed out
  at a Pidun Haben?
  
  I allow 1 cup of  raw rice for 10 people if there are alot of other side
  dishes being served or 1 cup raw if few sides dishes served.
  
  Place all ingredients into 9 by 13 pan (I use deep disposables) cover very
  well with foil.  Bake for aprox 45 minutes.  This recipe multiplies well
  and I was able to put 3 cup of raw rice (and the appropriate proportions of
  other ingredients into a deep disposable pan.
