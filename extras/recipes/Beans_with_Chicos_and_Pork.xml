      <step>    Chicos are a wonderful and very rich cornproduct. They consist of a rich
  sweet corn that is sun- or kiln-dried and then removed from the cob. They
  are a basic treat in the diet of the Southwest Indians, and I have come to
  just love the stuff. The use of corn and beans together should certainly
  tell you that this dish is legitimate. Remember the East Coast Indians made
  a similar dish called Misacquetash or succotash. This dish is much better.
  
    You will find chicos in any Mexican or Latin American market. They come
  in little 6-ounce bags and appear to be expensive, but you must remember
  that they swell up more than rice. They are rich in flavor and great in
  food value. If you cannot find them in your area it is worth sending away
  for them.
  
    Soak the chicos and beans together in ample water overnight.
  
    Put the oil in a medium-hot frying pan and saute the onion, garlic, and
  red pepper flakes until the onion is transparent. Remove from the pan and
  place in a 2-quart covered saucepan. Saute the pork in the same frying pan
  just until the meat begins to brown. Drain the chicos and beans and all of
  the ingredients to the saucepan and then add enough water to just barely
  cover. Add salt to taste and simmer, covered, until the beans and chicos
  are tender, about l hour.
  
     This is a very rich dish. It can be served as a side dish or as a main
  course. Add a vegetable dish and you have a complete meal.
  
    NOTE: Bacon can be substituted for the pork and the dish is very good
  that way. Use about 6 thick slices.
