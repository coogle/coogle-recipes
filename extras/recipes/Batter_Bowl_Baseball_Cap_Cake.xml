      <step>  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Prepare cake according to package directions.
  Grease Batter Bowl with vegetable oil shortening and dust with flour or
  spray lightly with a vegetableoil spray.   Pour batter into prepared Batter
  Bowl.  Bake 50-60 minutes or until a Cake Tester inserted in center comes
  out clean.  Cool 15 minutes on Non-Stick Cooling Rack, invert and remove
  Batter Bowl.  Cool 3-4 hours before decorating. To assemble cake, cut
  1-inch off from widest portion of cake.  With cut side down, using Batter
  Bowl as a guide, cut 1-inch cake slice in half (it will be crescent
  shaped).  This will form the bill of the cap.  Place the bill up against
  the larger round ed cake portion. Frost entire cake using 2 cups of icing.
  Tint remaining icing to desired color. Decorate cake using the Decorator
  Set.  Cut cake and serve.
