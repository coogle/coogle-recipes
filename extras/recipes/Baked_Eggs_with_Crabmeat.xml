  From: Trish &lt;TRISHMCKENNA@delphi.com&gt;
  Pick over the crabmeat and remove all the stiff membranes.  Beat the eggs
  slightly with a wire whisk, add milk and seasonings, and beat a little
  more. Stir in the crabmeat and pour into individual buttered casseroles.
  Cover and bake in a medium oven (350 degrees F) 30 minutes. Serves four.
  
  I found this recipe in an old cookbook I picked up at a yard sale.  The
  title, 150 Recipes  Casserole Cookery  One-dish Meals for the Busy Gourmet
  and the authors are Marian and Nino Tracy and it was first printed in 1940!
  The last print date is October 1950! I hope that you get a kick out of some
  of these recipes. Trish.
