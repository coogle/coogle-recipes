      <step>  The Chinese were enjoying noodles and pasta 5,000 years before the birth of
  Christ. During the same time, Europe was in the Stone Age, the great
  civilizations of Egypt, Greece and Rome would not exist for another 3,000
  years and in the Americas, only tall grasses grew where much of the wheat
  used to make pasta noodles is now produced.
  
  Today, pasta is a definitive convenience food that offers great variety,
  easy-preparation and high-quality nutrition. Try this Pasta Great for
  dinner tonight, and you'll appreciate the history of the noodle all the
  more!
  
  Wash and thoroughly dry asparagus. Place stalks in a baking pan large
  enough to hold them in one layer, and gently rub them with 1/2 tablespoon
  olive oil. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon salt over the asparagus and bake in a
  pre-heated 425-F degree oven for 12 to 15-minutes, depending upon the
  thickness of the stalks. Remove from oven and set aside. When cool enough
  to handle, cut into 1/2-inch pieces.
  
  Fill a large pasta pot with a generous amount of salted water and cook the
  Fettuccine until al dente. Drain, place in a bowl and toss with 1/2
  tablespoon olive oil.
  
  Pour wine into a large skillet or pan. Add shallots and reduce over medium
  heat to one half the original volume. Wash lemons well with soap and water
  to remove wax, rinse and dry. Add grated rind and juice from 2 lemons to
  the wine. Simmer another 2-minutes. Add cream to mixture and bring to a
  boil, then reduce heat and add 1/3 cup cheese, 1/4 teaspoon salt and
  cayenne pepper.
  
  Simmer slowly, whisking constantly, for approximately 4-minutes, or until
  sauce begins to thicken. Cut cold butter into small pieces and add to the
  sauce, cooking another minute. Add asparagus pieces, pasta and 2
  tablespoons cheese. Toss until pasta is thoroughly coated with sauce and
  heated through.
  
  Divide pasta evenly in heated plates or soup bowls. Sprinkle with grated
  peel from remaining lemon, chives and mint and serve.
