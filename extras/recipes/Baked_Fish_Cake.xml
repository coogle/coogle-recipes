      <step>  Cut the potatoes into chunks and place then in a saucepan with enough
  water to cover, adding a little salt if liked.  Heat until just about
  to boil. Meanwhile, lay the fish on a plate or dish to cover the
  saucepan and cover it with a second plate, lid or foil.  Put the fish
  on the pan when the water is boiling, then reduce the heat so water
  does not froth over. Cook the potatoes until tender-10-15 minutes if
  the chucks are faily small. Set the aside, without uncovering it.
  Drain and mash the potatoes, beating the well until smooth.  Mix in
  the butter, milk, lemon peel, parsley and anchovy extract, is used
  Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Grease a quicke dish or baking pan.
  Pour any cooking juices from the fish into the potato mixture.  Flake
  the flash off the skin, discarded any bones, and at it to the
  potatoes.  Mix well, adding seasoning to taste. Use a large spoon to
  place the fish mixture in a mound on the prepared dish or pan but do
  not flatten it until it is all in mounded up. Flatten the top of the
  mixture sightly, then sprinkle it with a little of the flour.  Use a
  spatula and slice to flatten the mixture into a little neat circle,
  about 7" across.  Pat the sides with the knife and the top with slice
  to that the mixture is even and neatly shaped, keep sprinkling with
  the flour to coat the outside evenly. Trickle the oil over the fish
  cake and bake it for about 30 minutes, until well browned.  Cut into
  wedges to serve.
