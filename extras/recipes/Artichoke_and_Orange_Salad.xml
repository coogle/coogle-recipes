      <step>  *To prepare the artichokes: Squeeze juice from 2 lemon halves into large
  bowl of cold water; add squeezed lemon halves. Cut off top half of each
  artichoke and discard. Cut of stem of artichoke. Starting at base, bend
  tough outer leaves back and snap off where they break naturally, leaving
  tender inner leaves. Using small sharp knife, trim outside of base until no
  dark green areas remain. Rub trimmed area with lemon half. Place in lemon
  water until ready to use.
  
  Drain artichokes. Cook in large pot of boiling salted water 4 minutes.
  Drain and cool. Cut into thin slices.
  
  Grate enough orange peel to measure 1 teaspoon. Transfer peel to large
  bowl. Squeeze in 1/3 cup juice from 1 orange. Using small sharp knife, cut
  off peel and white pith from remaining oranges. cut oranges crosswise into
  1/4 inch thick slices; set aside. Mix oil and vinegar into orange juice
  mixture in bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Mix in artichokes and onion.
  Let stand10 minutes.
  
  Using slotted spoon, arrange artichokes and onions on platter. Garnish with
  orange slices and olives. Drizzle vinaigrette from bowl over salad.
