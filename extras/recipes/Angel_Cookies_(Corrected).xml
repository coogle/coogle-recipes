      <step>  Preheat oven to 400 degress F. Combine cake mix and water; stir in the
  fruit. Cover cookie sheet with foil; drop cookies by rounded teaspoonful
  onto foil. Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until cookies become puffed and golden.
  Remove from oven; cool completely. Cals: 76 Fat: 1g Carbs:18g Note: There
  is no exact amount of fruit to add, so I put in as much as I liked to the
  batter. Leave the cookies on the foil when removed from the oven to cool on
  rack, and put new foil on the cookie sheet for the next batch and so on
