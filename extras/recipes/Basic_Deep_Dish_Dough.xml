      <step>  NOTE: I just bought Donna German's book THE BEST PIZZA IS MADE AT HOME and
  discovered her "secret" for Sicilian pizza dough. Evidently the difference
  in deep dish pizzas like the Sicilians is that they contain some sugar and
  a higher proportion of oil. Donna's recipe for the dough is simple.I made
  this for supper and did the dough in my bread machine on the "dough" cycle.
  It was made in my largest old iron skillet which I'd sprayed with olive oil
  Pam. After I took it from the ABM, I made the dough into a circle by trying
  to imitate those expert pizza chefs who fling the dough around. Mine didn't
  get flung too high but it worked! I spread it in the skillet and brought up
  the extra dough to form a lip around the edge, then put the pan to rise for
  30 minutes while preheating the oven to 475F. Bake the crust for 5 minutes
  by itself--but before you do that, prick it well with a fork all over.
  Before you add toppings, drizzle olive oil on the crust and spread it
  around with a brush. Toppings are up to you--but I used (in this order) 1
  cup mozzarella/cheddar cheese(grated), 2 cloves garlic (crushed), 1 cup
  slightly cooked fresh broccoli florets, a large sliced tomato, shredded
  fresh basil and feta cheese to top. It was VERY good! This makes a thick
  crust but it's so good there was none left to give to the birds! I hope
  Maria who first requested a Sicilian dough finds this--because I'd like to
  be able to share more of the goodies from this book with her! There are
  thin pizza doughs as well--and all kinds of toppings. The comments above
  were those of my friend Linda Calwell on Proidgy. Bev in Mn (Claycooker)
