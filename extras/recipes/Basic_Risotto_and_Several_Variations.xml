      <step>  Pick through the rice to remove any stones or foreign matter, but do not
  wash it before cooking.
  
  Using a large skillet with a heavy bottom, heat the olive oil over low eat
  and saute or "sweat" the onions until translucent, being careful not to
  allow them to color or brown at all.
  
  Add the Arborio rice, stir to coat with the olive oil, and saute with the
  onions to toast each grain of rice, about 7 minutes. This toasting process
  adds the chewy, al dente quality that attracts so many people to risotto.
  
  Once the rice is lightly toasted, add the white wine slowly, stirring with
  a wooden spoon. (A wooden spoon is always preferable when making risotto,
  as a metal spoon tends to cut or injure the grains of rice. Constant
  stirring should be avoided for the same reason.)
  
  Preheat the chicken stock just to the boiling point, then have it ready at
  stoveside. After the rice has absorbed the white wine and the skillet is
  nearly dry, add 1 cup stock, stirring occasionally, and cook over very low
  heat until the stock is absorbed. Continue adding the stock, 1 cup at a
  time, until all the stock has been absorbed.
  
  (Adding the liquid in stages, instead of all at once, allows the grains of
  rice to expand more fully, adding to the risotto's creamy texture.) Once
  the rice has been added to the pan, the entire cooking process will take
  about 17 to 20 minutes.
  
  After all of the liquid has been added and the rice is chewy yet fully
  cooked, with a creamy texture, add the butter, Parmesan, and heavy cream.
  Stir to combine all the ingredients and serve immediately. Yield: 4
  servings
