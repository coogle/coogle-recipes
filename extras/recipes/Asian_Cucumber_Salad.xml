  From: Crystalle Haynes &lt;crystall@po.EECS.Berkeley.EDU&gt;
  Well, I did it again!  I actually made up (well, sorta) a yummy recipe.
  This was adapted from a recipe by Bruce Cost.  It was origianlly called
  Szechuan, but after I eliminated the oil, and some other stuff, it tasted
  more Japanese to me, so I compromised and called it "Asian".
  
  The chili paste adds a bit of zing, but this is not hot at all.  Add more
  if you like it spicy. Also, the original recipe calls for the cucumbers to
  be peeled and seeded, but I am too lazy! I rather like it soupy, so seed
  them if you don't like your salad so soupy...
  :)
  
  Toss together and serve. *Yummy*!!!  :)
