      <step>  Directions--Conventional method (if using a bread machine, put in
  ingredients in order specified by machine manufacturer)
  
  In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm water. Stir in the malt and
  sugar, then the salt and flour. Knead the dough til smooth (by hand, mixer
  or machine). Shape the dough into a ball, place it in a lightly greased
  bowl covered with lightly greased plastic wrap (I use an inverted plate)
  and allow to rise til doubled in bulk, 1 to 1 1/2 hours (this is the "Dough
  Cycle" on the bread machine)
  
  When the dough has risen, punch it down and transfer it to a lightly
  greased work surface. Put the water for the bath into a large, shallow
  pan--the water should be about 3 inches deep (I use a stock- pot &amp; the
  water is usually about 6 in. deep)--and add the malt and sugar. Bring the
  water to a boil while you're shaping the bagels.
  
  Divide the dough into 16 pieces. Working with one piece of dough at a time,
  shape it into a ball, poke a hole through the center with your index
  finger, and work into a hole; the dough will form a ring. Place the bagels
  on a parchment-lined, lightly greased or cornmeal-sprinkled baking sheet as
  you shape them. Boil immediately (*don't* let them rise a second time--they
  tend to totally collapse when they get boiled if you do).
  
  Reduce the boiling water bath to a very gentle simmer. Gently transfer the
  bagels, 3 or 4 at a time, to the water bath; don't crowd them. Simmer them
  for about 30 sec. on each side, then return to the baking sheet.
  
  Bake the bagels in a preheated 425 deg. oven for 20 min. or until they're a
  deep golden brown. Yield 16-20 bagels, depending on size.
  
  Options: After boiling, but before baking, brush bagels with an egg-&amp;-water
  wash &amp; sprinkle poppy seeds, caraway seeds, sesame seeds, coarse salt,
  dehydrated onion, etc.
  
  For flavored bagels (like onion, rye or garlic) add ingredients to the
  dough before kneading. Bits of cooked spinach or fresh chive or garlic,
  diced onions, cinnamon and raisins are all popular.
