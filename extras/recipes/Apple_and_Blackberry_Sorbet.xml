  Combine apples, berries, and water in heavy saucepan.  Bring to boil over
  medium-high heat.  Cover, reduce heat to medium, and simmer until fruit is
  tender, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes.  Transfer to sieve set
  over large bowl. Press to force through as much fruit and juice as
  possible. Discard solids in Sieve. Return puree to same pot and stir in
  sugar and corn syrup. Cook, stirring, over low heat, just until sugar is
  dissolved. Transfer back to bowl and chill until cold. Process in ice cream
  freezer.
