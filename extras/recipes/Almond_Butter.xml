      <step>  Use two cups of blanched whole almonds. If only unblanched almonds are
  available, blanch them this way: Place the almonds in a saucepan and cover
  with water. Bring to boiling, then drain. The skins should slip off easily
  when you press each almond between your thumb and forefinger. Dry on paper
  towels. Spread the dry almonds in a shallow baking pan and toast in a 300
  degree oven for about 20 minutes or until golden. Cool for 5 minutes before
  processing or blending.
  
  To process: Place the steel blade in your food processor or blender. Add
  the nuts. Cover and process or blend until a butter forms, stopping
  occasionally to scrape the sides of the bowl or blender a few times. Keep
  processing for three to five minutes or until all of the mixture is evenly
  blended. Process about two minutes more or until the butter is the desired
  smoothness.Store in a covered container in your refrigerator for up to two
  weeks. Bring to room temperature for easier spreading. Makes about 1 1/4
  cups.
