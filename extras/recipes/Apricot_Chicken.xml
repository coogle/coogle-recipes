    <directions>
      <step>  Dust chicken in flour.  Fry chicken lightly until starting to brown. Place
  chicken in a casserole dish or a very deep frying pan. Add soup powder,
  nectar and apricots. Mix everything well. Simmer for 1 hour.
  
  I normally use 2 pieces of chicken per person and about a 1 1/2 lb can of
  apricot halves.  This will suffice for 4 to 6 people. If you cannot get
  nectar, then use the juice from the apricot halves. (Of course, if you can
  buy apricots in nectar...)
  
  The French onion soup quantity is not critical, but a soup packet that
  makes up about 6 C is about right for 4 to 6 people. Serve with potato
  (baked or boiled), buttered carrots and peas.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chicken embalmed in apricot nectar -- Apricot Chicken is the ultimate
  bachelors delight.  It is very simple and tastes wonderful. The recipe was
  given to me by a group of friends from back home who came to visit me.
  Yield: Serves 4-6.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
