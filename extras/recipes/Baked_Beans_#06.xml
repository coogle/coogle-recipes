      <step>   Either soak beans overnight in 8-10 times as much water or boild for one
  minute in above amount of water and let sit for an hour rinse, rinse and
  rinse again - this is the best way I've found for making them socially
  acceptable in small rooms.
  
   Cut and trim bacon.  I use scissors to cut a few slices at a time into
  1/2" pieces. You can generally pull excess fat off the small pieces easily.
  
   In a 3 qt/liter corning ware covered dish (this works very well and cleans
  well also) lay a layer of beans (about 1/5), squirt ketchup over the beans,
  sprinkle with brown sugar and (lightly) sprinkle dry mustard and pepper
  over all. Drop layer of bacon on top. Repeat until everything is used up.
  
   Add enough fresh water to cover everything by 1/8 inch, cover dish, and
  set in 300 deg. oven. Two hours later, check the water level. One hour
  later, do the same. Check every hour or so, until about 5-6 hours have
  passed.  By then they should be done.
