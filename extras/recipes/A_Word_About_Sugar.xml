      <step>  Remember that it is the total carbohydrate in a food that counts. All
  carbohydrates -- starches and sugars -- are eventually changed into blood
  glucose. Diabetics can eat sugar as long as it is counted as part of the
  total carbohydrate intake for the day. The goal though is to eat
  healthfully and to not waste your carbohydrates on foods that do not offer
  much in the way of nutrition (like most high sugar foods). The key with
  sugar is moderation! Also, remember that sugar free does not mean
  carbohydrate free. If you do consume foods with artificial sweeteners, be
  sure to check the total carbohydrate count in the food. Do not assume that
  it is a good food to eat just because it is sugar free. All of the recipes
  that we post on this site try to be low-fat, high-fiber and nutritious.
  Because of possible health risks, you will not see recipes with artificial
  sweeteners here. We post dessert recipes that, while they may contain some
  source of sugar (honey, sugar, fruit juice etc.), ! ! ! are relatively low
  in sugar for a dessert recipe. Again, use common sense and moderation when
  figuring any food with sugar into your diet.
