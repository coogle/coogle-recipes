  Place bananas (IN PEEL) on aluminum foil covered baking sheet bake for
  20-30 minutes @ 350 degrees or until peel becomes black. Remove from skin
  and place in dish. Top with a dollop of whipped topping.
  
  This is especially good if the bananas are ripe.   Bananas come out almost
  tasting as if liquer has been added.
