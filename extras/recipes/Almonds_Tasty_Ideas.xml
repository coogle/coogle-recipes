      <step>  The mild flavor of almonds is the perfect complement to vibrant Asian
  flavors. Try tossing finely diced toasted almonds into a ginger-shrimp
  saute' or adding toasted whole natural almonds to Chinese. More tasty
  ideas.
  
  Whether you're serving salad or soup, pasta or poultry, almonds are a
  natural and healthful addition to any menu. With their excellent
  nutritional profile, almonds can be a part of an overall balanced diet.
  Here are some heart-healthy tips for incorporating wholesome, crunchy
  almonds into your diet:
  
  Make "nut crumbs" by adding whole toasted almonds to the bowl of a food
  processor and pulsing on and off until the almonds are coarsely ground. Use
  them as a wholesome gratin topping for casseroles, or sprinkle on pasta and
  grain dishes.
  
  Bursting with flavor, savory seasoned almonds are the perfect topping for
  your favorite side or main dish. In a nonstick skillet over medium-low
  heat, toss whole natural or slivered almonds in a small amount of vegetable
  oil until golden. Add your choice of dried herbs, then sprinkle over
  salads, vegetables and pasta.
  
  Mix toasted slivered or sliced almonds into grain-based dishes, such as
  Middle Eastern classic tabbouleh or other bulgur wheat salads to add
  flavor, nutrition and crunch. Or pair them with quinoa, hailed as the
  "super grain of the future" for its healthful nutrition profile.
  
  The mild flavor of almonds is the perfect complement to vibrant Asian
  flavors. Try tossing finely diced toasted almonds into a ginger-shrimp
  saute or adding toasted whole natural almonds to Chinese vegetable stir-fry
  dishes.
  
  Almond butter is a nutritious and hearty topping for bagels or muffins.
  And, it's easy to make at home by chopping whole natural almonds in a food
  processor with a little vegetable oil, salt and sugar until almost smooth.
  
  Visual appeal is important in low-fat cooking. Make a prudent parfait look
  sinful by layering frozen yogurt, pureed frozen berries and toasted sliced
  almonds in an elegant stemmed glass. Or, make individual trifles by adding
  layers of cubed angel food cake. Garnish with sprigs of mint, sliced
  almonds or whole berries, and serve with almond biscotti.
  
  The buttery flavor and crunchy texture of almonds make them a perfect
  topper for freshly baked low-fat scones and breads. Before baking scones,
  brush them with milk or egg white and top with slivered or chopped almonds.
  And for extra special quick breads sprinkle chopped almonds on them before
  baking, or knead toasted chopped or slivered almonds into yeast bread
  dough.
  
  To give hot cereal just a little more panache, mix in dried cranberries or
  cherries and a generous amount of chopped toasted almonds just before
  serving. Serve with skim milk and a drizzle of maple syrup.
  
  Satisfy your palate while watching your waistline by steaming your favorite
  fresh fish and vegetables and sprinkling them with toasted, sliced almonds.
  Serve with wedges of lemon or lime. You get all the flavor and all the
  benefits of a healthy, low-fat meal.
  
  Plain roasted chicken is enhanced by stuffing it with diced apples, onions,
  garlic, herbs and coarsely chopped, toasted whole almonds.
