      <step>    In a large, deep bowl, beat the lemon juice and flour together with a
  whisk or spoon, add the water and beat to a smooth thin paste.  Set aside.
    With a small, sharp knife, trim 1/8 inch off the stem end of each
  artichoke and peel the tough outer skin from the remaining stem. Snap off
  the small bottom leaves and any bruised or discolored outer leaves. Lay
  each artichoke on its side, grip it firmly, and with a large knife slice
  about 1 inch off the top.  Spread the top leaves apart gently and pull out
  the inner core of thistle like yellow leaves. With a long handled spoon,
  scrape out the hair choke inside. Drop the artichokes into the lemon juice
  mixture, turning them about to coat them evenly and let them soak while you
  make the sauce.
    Heat the olive oil over moderate heat in a shallow enameled or stainless
  steel casserole large enough to hold the artichokes comfortably. Add the
  onions and cook for 5 minutes, or until they are soft and transparent but
  not brown.  Drain the artichoke soaking liquid into the casserole, add the
  dill and salt and, stirring constantly, bring to a boil over high heat.
    Lay  the artichokes side by side in the sauce and baste them thoroughly.
  Reduce the heat to low, cover tightly, and simmer for 20 minutes. Then turn
  the artichokes over and, basting occasionally, simmer 25 minutes longer, or
  until their bases show no resistance when pierced with the pint of a small
  knife.  Remove from the heat and let the artichokes cool to room
  temperature.  To serve, arrange on a platter and spoon the sauce over them.
