    <directions>
      <step>  Cream butter and sugar at least 10 minutes by hand, or 5 minutes in
  electric mixer. The mixture should be thick and white. Add eggs one at a
  time, beating well after each addition. Stir in vanilla. If the baker's
  ammonia is in granular form, crush to a powder with a rolling pin or a
  bottle. Sift flour and bakers ammonia together. Stir flour into egg mixture
  and blend thoroughly. Dough will be soft. Chill for at least 30 minutes.
  
  Cut 6 to 8 -- 8" rounds from waxed paper. Spread the dough thinly and
  evenly on paper rounds, leaving about half-inch margin to allow for
  expansion during baking.
  
  Place to or three round (whatever it will hold) on a baking sheet. Bake at
  400Â° 8 to 10 minutes, until golden brown on edges. Remove at once from
  cookie sheet, but do not remove paper until you are ready to assemble cake.
  Assemble by placing well-spiced apple butter between each layer. Leave top
  unadorned.
  
  *The baker's amonia (ammonium carbonate or hartshorn) may be bought at
  drugstores. Or 3 3/4 tsp baking powder may be substituted.
