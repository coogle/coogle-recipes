      <step>  From: dcross@pts.mot.com (Daniel Cross X8663 P5108).  About the quickest
  tofu recipe I know is this one: Mix some flour (about .5 cup) with your
  favorite spices (I like cayenne). Press most of the water out of a block of
  tofu with a towel, then slice it up any old way. Dip the slices in soy
  sauce, then in the flour/spice mix, and place on a baking tray. Bake for
  20-30 minutes (a toaster-oven is great for this). If you like them browned
  a little more, put them under the broiler for 5 min. before serving.
  
  From: samv@netcom.com (Sam Voeller).  sort of a boring tofu user myself,
  but one recipe I have is so yummy I use it in all sorts of things. Preheat
  oven to 350 degrees (f) cut tofu (firm) into 1" cubes dip cubed tofu in soy
  sauce, and dust on all sides with fresh-ground black pepper set on lightly
  oiled (or non-stick) baking sheet and bake for 30 minutes, turning once so
  that all sides are browned evenly. This gives the tofu some real, chewable
  texture, as well as a spicey zing.  I use these tofu chunks in thick stews,
  or just over steamed veggies.
