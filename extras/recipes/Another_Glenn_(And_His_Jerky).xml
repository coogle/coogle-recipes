    <directions>
      <step>  Well I start with a lean peice of beef, ussualy brisket, sometimes eye of
  round. I cut it in slices about a 1/4 of a inch thick, then trim all
  remaining fat off, and cut into strips about a inch wide and six inchs
  long. I place the meat in large Zip-lock type freezer bags. Then I marinate
  the meat over night in as soy/worchestershire/sugar/salt/habenaro liquid.
  Then I lay the meat out on my racks, being carfull not to allow the meat to
  rest in spots that have exsesive heat(like the outsid edges of my round
  water smoker grills). I currently use a water/gas/wood smoker with a
  adjustable flame level and tin foil log made of soaked wood chips. I
  sometimes use hickory and sometimes mesquite. I can fit about 8 lbs. of
  meat in my smoker, on about 8 racks all stacked on top of each other about
  a inch apart. I smoke/cook for about 8 hours, adding three new tin foil
  logs about every hour or hour and a half, when they stop smoking.
  
  The meat around the edges tends to get done faster, then the stuff in the
  middle, but I generaly seperate the well done stuff from the perfectly done
  stuff when I remove it all at once... I eat the well done stuff nearly
  imediately, and save the other stuff for later, or give some away... I find
  it keeps in zip lock bags in the fridge nearly indefintly or if your really
  concerned about it spoiling, it freezes extreemly well too. I have also
  dryed some out in a dehydrator and kept it un-refrigerated for more then a
  week and then ate it without any adverse effects.(but it's too dry to taste
  really good).
  
  Hot pepper water.... I purchase habanaros periodicy at the store for about
  $2 a pound and I dry them in my dehydrator.(I may soon be trying to smoke
  some) I grind/crush the dryed habanaros and put them in bottles to use
  later. I have about 10 cups worth of them around now... I use about a 1/4
  cup of dryed crushed habanaros in my hot peper water... I just boil them in
  the water and then strain out the rehydrated peper remnents because I don't
  want that stuff clinging to my jerky...
  
  Be extreemly carefull when making and using this hot pepper water... it can
  be very potent, and the steam from the boiling water can really be quite
  unforgiving to your lungs if you inhale a deep breath of it... You may even
  want to do this outdoors if you have housemates(I don't). Don't get any of
  this stuff near any sensitive areas of your body...
  
  That's basicly my method for making what I generaly call HOT/Sweet Jerky.
  
  You could use crushed red pepper insted of habanaros...
  
  Everyone I have ever given my jerky too, loves it, some complain it's a bit
  too hot, and sometime I'd agree... Some say it's a bit sweet( I might agree
  with that too sometimes) I rarely follow any real recipies, so most of my
  stuff comes out slightly differnt every time...
