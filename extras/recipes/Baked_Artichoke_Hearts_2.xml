      <step>  Artichoke hearts are good with a sprinkling of olive oil, dried basil to
  taste crumbled over, salt and freshly ground pepper to taste, and a tiny
  bit of balsamic vinegar -- all micro-waved for about 2 minutes (just to
  marry the flavours) or heated in a regular oven for maybe 8 minutes at
  about 325F.
  
  This is good for antipasto or appetizers, great with chunks of feta and
  chopped sun-dried tomatoes.
