      <step>  [Note: Instead of the unsweetened chocolate, I just used an extra 4ozs of
  plain chocolate, and got perfect results. I think as long as you're using
  *really* good plain chocolate, say at least 55% cocoa solids, it doesn't
  really matter!]
  
  Preheat the oven to 325F / 170C / Gas 3.
  
  Sift together the flour, cocoa powder, bicarbonate of soda, and salt. Set
  aside.
  
  Heat 1 inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over medium
  heat. Place the plain and the unsweetened chocolates in the top half of the
  double boiler. Tightly cover the top with cling film and allow to heat for
  12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir until smooth. Keep at room
  temperature until needed.
  
  Place the soft light brown sugar and butter in the bowl of an electric
  mixer fitted with a paddle. Beat on medium for 1 minute. Scrape down the
  bowl and beat on high for an additional 30 seconds. Scrape down the bowl.
  Add the eggs, one at a time, while beating on medium, and stopping to
  scrape down the bowl after incorporating each addition. Add the vanilla
  essence and beat on medium for 30 seconds. Add the melted chocolate and
  beat on low for 10 seconds more. Scrape down the bowl and beat for an
  additional 30 seconds. Add the sifted flour, cocoa powder, bicarbonate of
  soda, and salt, and the chocolate chips, and beat on low until thoroughly
  combined - about 20 to 30 seconds. Remove the bowl from the mixer and mix
  thoroughly with a rubber spatula.
  
  Portion 6 to 8 biscuits per baking sheet by dropping 2 level tablespoons of
  batter per biscuit onto each of 2 non-stick baking sheets. Place the
  biscuits on the top and middle shelves of the preheated oven and bake for
  18 to 22 minutes, rotating the sheets from top to bottom about halfway
  through the baking time. Allow the biscuits to cool for 5 to 6 minutes on
  the baking sheets. Transfer the biscuits to a cooling rack to thoroughly
  cool before storing in a sealed plastic container. Repeat this
  
  procedure until all the biscuits have been baked.
  
  Makes 3 to 3.  5 dozen biscuits
