      <step>  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cut off the very top of the pineapple and
  place it in a roasting pan. Roast the whole pineapple for about 1 hour,
  then remove from the oven and, as soon as it is cool enough to handle, cut
  it first into 8 thick rounds, crosswise. Cut these slices in half and
  arrange on a platter. Squeeze the lime juice over the pineapple, dust with
  cayenne pepper, and sprinkle with a little chopped parsley. (Pineapple will
  dry out if it is not roasted whole. Diners should pick up the halfrounds of
  pineapple with their hands and nibble the tender flesh from the inside of
  the rind.) Yield: 6 to 8 servings Copyright, 1996, TV FOOD NETWORK, G.P.,
