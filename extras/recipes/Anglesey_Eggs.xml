      <step>  Trim the leeks and wash them thoroughly. Cut into 1 inch lengths. Put the
  milk ( or milk / cream mixture) into a non-stick saucepan with the leeks
  and bring to the boil. If you like your leeks soft rather than slightly
  crisp, let them boil for a minute or two. Remove the leeks (leaving the
  milk in the pan) and put them into a baking dish. Put the eggs cold into
  boiling water and cook for exactly five minutes. Remove, cool and shell.
  The eggs should be soft in the middle but the whites will be firm. Lay the
  shelled eggs on the leeks. Make a white sauce by whisking in the cornflour,
  salt and butter and bring gently to the boil while you whisk. When the
  sauce is smooth, thick and glossy, pour it over the eggs and leeks,
  sprinkle the top with nutmeg and grated cheese and put it under the grill
  until it is hot and bubbling. Don't leave it too long or the eggs will be
  over-cooked. Serve at once with lots of crusty bread and butter
