      <step>  In a large mixing bowl, combine the chilled butter, 3 cups of the flour and
  the sugar and, with your fingertips, rub until the mixture resembles flakes
  of coarse meal. Beat in the egg and continue to mix until the pastry is
  smooth.  Shape it into a ball, wrap it in wax paper, and refrigerate 1
  hour, or until the dough is form.
  
  With the back of a spoon, rub the preserves through a fine sieve set over a
  1-quart saucepan, then cook over moderate heat, stirring constantly, for 3
  to 5 minutes, or until they thicken into a thin puree. Set aside off the
  heat.
  
  Preheat the oven to 250F.  Cut the chilled pastry in half and shape each
  half into a rectangle.  One half at a time, roll the pastry between two
  sheets of lightly floured wax paper into a rectangle approximately 10
  inches wide and 15 inches long.  With a pastry brush, coat each of 2 cookie
  sheets with 1 tablespoon of butter and sprinkle them with flour, tipping
  the sheets from side to side to coat them evenly. Then invert the sheets
  and tap them against a hard surface to dislodge any excess flour. Peel off
  the top sheets of wax paper and use the bottom ones to lift the 2
  rectangles of pastry onto the 2 cookie sheets. Peel off the remaining
  sheets of wax paper. Bake 40 minutes, or until the pastry begins to turn a
  pale gold.  Watch carefully for any sign of burning and regulate the heat
  accordingly.
  
  With a metal spatula, spread the raspberry puree evenly over one sheet of
  the pastry, covering it completely and smoothly. Slide the second sheet of
  pastry gently onto the first.
  
  With a spoon stir the sugar, water and lemon juice together in a large
  mixing bowl to form a thin paste. Spread the icing over the top layer of
  pastry with the spatula, and set the cake aside to cool to room
  temperature.  With a small, sharp knife or pastry wheel, slice the
  Aleksander Torte into strips 1 inch wide and 2 inches long, cutting the
  ends on the diagonal.
