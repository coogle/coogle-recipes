      <step>  Here are a couple of recipes for almond pudding.  There are lots of
  variations of this dish some using dairy products, some using gelatin
  and some using agar agar and some combining them.  It IS good!  This
  first one is more "from scratch".  The second uses almond extract.
  
  Mix the almonds and rice in a bowl with 2 pints (5 cups) cold water,
  cover and leave for 2 hours.  Strain through a fine muslin into a
  large bowl. Add milk and mix well.
  
  Stand the bowl in a large saucepan with enough boiling water to come
  halfway up the sides of the bowl.  Cover and simmer for 2 hours,
  stirring occasionally.
  
  Add the sugar, stir well and leave to cool slightly.  Mix the gelatin
  with 2 tablespoons (2 1/2 T) hot water until dissolved.  Stir into
  the milk mixture when almost cold.  Mix well and pour into a shallow
  serving dish. Leave until set.
