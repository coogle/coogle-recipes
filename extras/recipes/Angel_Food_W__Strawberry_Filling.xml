      <step>  Bake the Angel food cake according to directions on pkg. Cool.
  
  Thaw strawberries in colander over a bowl to catch liquid. Cook the fruit
  liquid in a saucepan, to simmer. Mix cornstarch (I don't have amounts) with
  water and stir into hot fruit liquid to thicken, while it is still cooking
  bringing it to a near boil. Stirring constantly so to keep it smooth. You
  may have to add more cornstarch, if it is too thin. (This should be
  somewhat thick). Add the fruit to this mixture, and let cool.
  
  When cake is cooled, cut in half, horizontally. Spread fruit mixture on
  bottom half and top with the top half.
  
  Spread whipping cream all over.
  
  This should be refrigerated.
