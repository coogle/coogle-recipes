      <step>  In bowl of an electric mixer stir sugar into 2 1/4 cups warm water (110
  degrees) until dissolved. Sprinkle yeast over and set aside until frothy,
  about 10 minutes. In a large bowl mix together flour and salt; rub in
  butter with your fingers. Place bowl with yeast mixture on electric mixer
  fitted with dough hook. Start machine on slow speed and gradually add flour
  mixture to yeast mixture. Your dough should be firm; add more flour if
  needed. Mix until dough comes together.
  
  Flour work surface and turn out dough. Knead until smooth and elastic. Oil
  a bowl and add dough, turning to coat top. Cover and set aside to double in
  size. Turn out onto a lightly-floured surface. Punch dough down and cut
  into small workable pieces of dough. Shape into desired shape, such as
  knots, crescents, breadsticks, round rolls, or Parker House rolls; place on
  a baking sheet, leaving enough room between them for rolls to double. Cover
  with a towel and place in a warm draft-free place to double.
  
  Preheat oven to 400 degrees. For shiny rolls, brush with egg wash, if
  desired. Sprinkle tops with choice of suggested garnishes. Bake until
  golden brown and sound hollow when tapped. For thicker, harder crusts,
  place a small bowl of water in your oven during cooking to provide steam;
  you can also spray your oven with a water mister several times during
  baking.
  
  Yield: 12 to 15 rolls, depending on size
