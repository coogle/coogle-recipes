  1.  Add all ingredients for the dough except the barley malt syrup in the
    order suggested by your bread machine.  Process on the manual cycle.
  
  2.  At the end of the cycle, remove the dough from the machine.  Preheat
  the
    oven to 375 degrees.  In a large pot, bring 2 quarts of water to a boil.
  
  3.  While the water comes to a boil, divide the dough into 8 pieces.  Roll
    each piece into a rope 12 inches long.  Make a circle of each piece,
    overlapping the ends by at least an inch and pressing or rolling the
    overlap tightly to seal.  Let the bagels rise for only 5 minutes.
  
  4.  Add the malt syrup to the boling water.  Lower the bagels a few at a
  time
    into the water.  As soon as the bagels rise to the top, remove them with
    a spatula and place on a lightly greased baking sheet.  Sprinkle with
    .75 teaspoon of any of the toppings over each bagel and bake for
       20    minutes, or until golden.
  
  NOTES:
  
    I couldn't find barley malt syrup, so I used molasses.  It seems to work
    in almost the same way.
  
    I make 4 bagels out of this recipe, instead of 8.  They seem to be the
    same size as the kind you would buy in the store if there are 4 of them.
    If you want them smaller, make 8.
  
  Enjoy!
