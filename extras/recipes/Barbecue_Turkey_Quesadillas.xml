  These look difficult but once you make it the first time, you'll get the
  hang of it in no time flat.
  
  Lay out all ingredients on a large work surface such as kitchen table. Heat
  a skillet on high.  While you are assembling a quesadilla, have one
  browning at the same time. Remember to brown both sides.
  
  Assembly:  Place ingredients in the order listed above on top of one
  tortilla.  Cover with another tortilla and press down with open palm to
  flatten.
  
  Cutting:  The easiest way to do this is with a clean pair of sharp
  scissors. All them to cool down enough to handle and cut into 4 triangles.
  These are great for parties and you can make them ahead and reheat in the
  oven.
