    <directions>
      <step>  1. Adjust oven rack to middle position- heat oven to 500 degrees. Elevate
  roasting rack by crumpling four sheets of aluminum foil into balls and
  placing them underneath rack to raise it slightly above edge of pan-,
  lightly oil roasting rack.
  
  2. Season cavity with salt and pepper to taste- place aromatics in cavity.
  Pin flaps of skin at leg end together. If legs splay badly, tie drumstick
  ends loosely together. Arrange chicken, backside up, on rack.
  
  3. Roast chicken, brushing bird with butter or pan juices every 8 to 1 0
  
  minutes. (If pan juices begin to spatter loudly, add a few tablespoons of
  water to pan" repeat whenever necessary).
  
  4. After 20 minutes (for a small chicken) to 30 minutes (for a chicken
  approaching 5 pounds), season legs and turn chicken, breast side up,
  pouring juices from body cavity into pan. Prop up the breast end with 1 -
  ~inch-thick wad of foil under the back. Baste and return to oven.
  
  5. Roast chicken, basting every 7 to 8 minutes, until breast side has
  browned sufficiently. Turn down oven to 325 degrees and prop oven door open
  for a minute or two to quickly bring temperature down. After 40 minutes
  total cooking time (50 minutes for large birds) season breast and legs,
  then check inner breast temperature by inserting thermometer from neck-end
  along ribs. When thermometer registers 148 to 150 degrees (145 degrees if
  you don't mind some slightly pink spots), the breast is done.
  
  Figure on breast temperature rising 2 degrees (larger birds) to 3 degrees
  (small ones) for every additional minute in oven. When breast is done,
  insert thermometer into thigh meat closest to body-, it should read at
  least 160 degrees.
  
  6. When chicken is done, tip cavity juices into pan and poke skin below
  thigh to release under-skin juices. Transfer chicken with rack to a plate,
  let rest for at least 20 minutes before serving.
