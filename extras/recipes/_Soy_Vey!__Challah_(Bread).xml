    <directions>
      <step>  1. Mix the soy milk, honey, and yeast and set it aside for 10 minutes. 2.
  Combine the bread flour and soy flour in a large bowl. 3. Add the oil,
  eggs, and egg yolk to the milk, honey, and yeast mixture. Stir with a
  wooden spoon until blended. 4. Add the flours to the liquid mixture, stir
  until a dough is formed, and turn the dough out onto a floured board. 5.
  Knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. 6. Form into a
  ball, coat with a bit of soybean oil, and place in a covered bowl. 7. Let
  rise until doubled in bulk, about an hour. 8. Punch the dough down, knead
  about 3 minutes, and braid or shape into any desired form. 9. Transfer to a
  greased baking sheet. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes.
  10. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. 11. Beat the egg white with a folk. Use a
  brush to coat the top of the loaf. Sprinkle poppy seeds on top of loaf. 12.
  Bake at 375 degrees for 20 minutes. 13. Cool on a rack.
  
  Baking temperature: 375 degrees Baking time: 20 minutes Yield: One large
  loaf This recipe won first place in a special competition at the Ohio State
  Fair this year: Cooking with Ohio's Soy Foods, sponsored by the Ohio
  Soybean Council. It also received an "award of Excellence" rosette.
  
  You can also use this recipe in a bread machine, either by going through
  the whole cycle, or by using the dough setting and shaping the dough into a
  large braid, which is what I usually do.. If you're not wild about soy, you
  can change the soy milk to water, and the soy oil to another kind of oil.
