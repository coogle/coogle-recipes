      <step>  Squeeze juice from lemons and slice the rind into paper thin strips
  Boil the sugar and water for 10 minutes, then add the juice and rind,
  the bananas, ginger and a few cloves (to taste).
  
  Cook slowly for 1/2 to 3/4 of an hour. Stir carefully so it won't
  scorch. It'll be pale (actually a weird pinkish color.) Take out
  ginger. Put in jars and process 10 minutes in water bath covered by
  1". About 7 8oz jars.
  
  This is truly a strange "jam." But it's delicious on toast, waffles,
  or muffins, and little kids like it.
  
  I discovered by accident that banana jam also makes a truly wonderful
  filling for one of my favorite desserts, a little number called
  Farfel Cake (which contains no farfel and is not a cake.) I will
  provide it. It really is a great recipe--easy to make, delicious to
  eat and even a little impressive to look at.  Great with hot coffee
  or tea.
