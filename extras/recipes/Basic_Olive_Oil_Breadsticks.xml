    <directions>
      <step>  Place the water in a small bowl and whisk in yeast. Allow yeast to soften
  while preparing remaining ingredients.
  
  Place flour and salt in work bowl of food processor fitted with metal
  blade. Pulse 2 or 3 times to mix. Add oil and pulse ten times to mix
  thoroughly. Add yeast mixture, being careful to scrape all yeast from bowl
  with a rubber spatula. Pulse again until the dough forms a ball, about ten
  more times. Let the dough rest in the work bowl for 5 minutes, then run the
  machine continuously for 10 seconds, for a final mixing of the dough.
  
  Remove dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead lightly to form a
  smooth ball. Place the dough in an oiled bowl and turn dough to coat all
  surfaces. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let dough rise at room
  temperature until double in bulk, about an hour.
  
  After dough has risen, remove from bowl to lightly floured work surface and
  knead lightly to deflate. Form dough into a ball and place in oiled bowl,
  turning dough to coat all surfaces. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and
  refrigerate dough for 2 hours (or up to 24 hours) before proceeding.
  
  Preheat oven to 325 degrees and set racks in upper and lower thirds. Cover
  three jelly roll pans with cornmeal, using a tablespoon or so for each pan.
  
  Scrape refrigerated dough from bowl to a lightly floured work surface,
  making sure dough emerges from bowl in one piece and doesn't fold. Press
  dough into a 9-inch square. Cut dough into 2 rectangles, each 4 1/2 by
  9-inches. Then cut each rectangle into 1/2 by 4 1/2-inch lengths, to make
  36 pieces in all. Cover the cut pieces of dough with plastic wrap or a
  towel to keep them from forming a skin. One at a time, roll pieces of dough
  under palms of hands, stretching at the same time, to make narrow sticks
  about 15-inches long. If dough resists, set pieces aside under plastic wrap
  or towel to rest for 5 minutes, and they will roll and stretch easily.
  
  As breadsticks are formed, arrange them in length of pan, about 10 or 12 to
  a pan, keeping them about 1/2-inch apart. Let the breadsticks rest about 10
  minutes, then bake the first two pans for about 20 to 30 minutes, until
  they are firm, crisp and light golden. The third pan may wait while the
  first ones are baking. Cool the breadsticks on the pans or on racks. Store
  breadsticks in a paper bag or loosely covered with plastic wrap at room
  temperature. If they absorb humidity and soften, bake them again for 5
  minutes at 325 degrees.
  
  Yield: 36 breadsticks
