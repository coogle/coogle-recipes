      <step>    Soak the beans overnight in cold water. Drain, rub off and discard the
  skin, cover beans again with cold water and soak for 2-3 hours longer.
  Drain, rinse, and put through a meat grinder using the finest blade, or
  reduce bit by bit in an electric blender. Grind the peppers. Add the salt
  and peppers to the beans and beat with a wooden spoon until they are light
  and fluffy and considerably increased in bulk.
    Heat the oil in a heavy frying pan and fry the mixture by tablespoonfuls
  until golden brown on both sides. Drain on paper towels. Serve hot as an
  accompaniment to drinks.
