  RECIPES USING ANCHO CHILES (by Diana Kennedy)
  
  ANCHOS are the favorite chile for flavoring Chili Con Carne.  Toast in
  skillet as shown below and either soak and blend to puree, or place in
  blender or coffee grinder and make chili powder. One Ancho equals 1 Tbsp.
  chili powder.
  
  TO PREPARE ANCHOS:  Toast 4 large Ancho chiles lightly on a griddle,
  turning from time to time so that they do not burn, for 2-4 minutes. Slit
  chiles and remove seeds, veins and stems. Put chiles into a bowl and cover
  with boiling water. Let stand 20 minutes.
