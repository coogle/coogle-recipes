      <step>  This was originally posted by Virginia Sauer and is wonderful.
  
  (These are the easiest pickles I have ever made. They have a wonderful,
  fresh taste, and can either be processed or simply stored in the
  refrigerator.)
  
  . Drain sliced cucumbers on rack.
  
  . Combine cucumbers, onions, and garlic.
  
  . Add salt; mix thoroughly.
  
  . Cover with crushed ice or ice cubes. Set aside for 3 hours.
  
  . Remove garlic cloves.
  
  . Drain thoroughly in colander.
  
  . Pour sugar, vinegar, and pickling spices into 3-quart saucepan. Bring to
  a boil.
  
  . Add drained cucumber and onion spices.
  
  . If using the refrigerator pickle method (which is what I do): - Heat 15
  minutes. - Pour into hot, clean jars. - Store in refrigerator.
  
  . If you are instead going to process the pickles: - Heat only 5 minutes. -
  Pack loosely into clean hot pint jars to 1/2-inch of top. - Adjust jar
  lids, and process in boiling water for 5 minutes, beginning to count
  processing time as soon as water in canner returns to boiling. - Remove
  jars and complete seals if necessary. - Set jars upright to cool.
  
  Yield: Approximately 1 Quart
  
  Variation: Although I have not yet tried this, the lady who gave me the
  recipe says that it can be quadrupled, using 4 quarts (6 lbs, or 10 medium)
  cucumbers, 1 pound (12 - 15 small white) onions, 2 large garlic cloves, 1/3
  cup salt, 2 trays ice cubes, 3 cups sugar, 3 cups vinegar, 2 tablespoons
  mustard seed, 1/2 tablespoon celery seed, and 1/2 tablespoon turmeric).
