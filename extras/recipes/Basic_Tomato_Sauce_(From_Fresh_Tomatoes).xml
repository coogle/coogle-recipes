      <step>  Cut tomatoes in half, sprinkle with salt and place the tomatoes face down
  in a colander for half an hour or more. Now, gently squeeze out of the
  tomatoes as many seeds as you can, and then place the tomatoes in a large
  pan. Cover and simmer gently for a few minutes (5 to 10). DON'T STIR! Drain
  away the yellow "juice", because it is very sour. At this point, we use a
  special utensil to separate the pulp from the skin.
  
  Bring the pulp to the boil and pour it into glass jars while boiling -
  proceed carefully, to prevent jars from cracking, and fill up one jar at a
  time (the pan should stay on the stove, simmering gently, all the time). As
  an optional extra, you can add a few leaves of basil in each jar, before
  filling the jar with sauce.
  
  Cover each jar with its lid as soon as it's full (you'll have to act
  quickly, as in less than a minute the jar can get to a too high temp for
  you to touch it!). Place jars in a large cardboard box, wrapping each jar
  in rags (preferably woolen). Store the jars close together in the box and
  let them stand overnight (24 hours at least). Don't be surprised if you
  find that the jars, when you open the box after 24 hours, are still hot:
  this is the best sterilizing method I know!
  
  This is the way we make our tomato sauce for "winter storage". It keeps for
  at least one year. You can use this basic sauce as a base for any kind of
  spaghetti sauce. As it has a very natural tomato flavour, it's also perfect
  for stews, soups, pizza, and all sorts of other tomato based preparations.
