      <step>  Cook the rice so that it comes out a bit dry (if it is very sticky and damp
  let it dry some by spreading it on a tray for a while.) After the rice
  cools, add all other ingredients, mix well, and sort of knead the mixture a
  bit until it feels a bit sticky. Form into patties about 4 inches round and
  about 1/2 to 3/4 inches thick (don't make them to thin). Place on a
  nonstick baking sheet, and put into a preheated 450 degree oven. Let cook
  for about 25 minutes, flip and cook for another 10 to 15 minutes. If the
  mixture was too wet the burgers will kind of flow and get thin. When you
  are making the patties you will probably think that this can't be done. My
  family loves these with onion tomato and coarse mustard. Thanks to a kind
  person at the local Wellspring Grocery and Deli who was kind enough to
  share a recipe with their customers.
