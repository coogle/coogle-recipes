      <step>  Cut away the lower 4th of the asparagus and peel the stalk. This way the
  entire spear is edible will cook more quickly and at the same rate.
  
  Bring 2 inches of water to a boil in a casserole or skillet large enough to
  accommodate the asparagus in one single flat layer.
  
  Add the asparagus to the water, cover and quickly bring the water back to a
  boil. Uncover the skillet and simmer for 4 to 5 minutes or until the
  asparagus are just tender. They should be just cooked through but still
  with some crunch left it.
  
  Serving suggestions: For 1 pound asparagus, melt 4 tablespoons butter and
  mash in 2 hard boiled eggs. Season to taste with salt, pepper and snipped
  fresh chives. Dip warm asparagus into the mixture and accompany with bread.
  
  Serve asparagus at room temperature, either plain or dressed with
  vinaigrette and accompanied with goat cheese bruschetta.
  
  Yield: 2 servings
