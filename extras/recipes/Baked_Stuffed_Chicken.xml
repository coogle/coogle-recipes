  The following are from today's (August 2, 1996) edition of the Jerusalem
  POST. This food writer, Daniel Rogov, is known for printing a lot of
  non-kosher recipes (to the dismay of a lot of JP readers), so I will spare
  you the French recipe (which uses goat cheese!). In all cases, I've changed
  butter to margarine and converted the metric measures to English
  approximations. These can be good anytime, but I'm thinking ahead to Rosh
  Hashana.
  
  The writer notes: "Despite their drawbacks, even mass-produced chickens can
  be made tasty, and there is no better way to prepare a chicken than by
  stuffing it with ingredients that complement and highlight the natural
  flavor of the meat. Italians are particularly fond of stuffing their
  chickens with rice and celery; the French use celery and onions; Egyptians,
  Syrians and Jordanians rely heavily on the use of nuts ..."
  
  Clean the chicken well, discarding the excess fat. Sprinkle lightly inside
  and out with salt. Let stand for 1 hour and then rinse in running water. [I
  doubt whether this is necessary if one soaks it in salted water for
  koshering.] Pat dry with toweling.
  
  In a bowl, mix together the chopped beef, onion, garlic and lemon rind. Add
  the rice, nuts and parsley and 1/2 tsp each of the salt and pepper. Mix
  well by hand and then saute' in a skillet with 1/4 cup of the oil, sauteing
  until the onions are translucent.
  
  With this mixture, stuff the cavity of the chicken. Sew closed.
  
  Place the stuffed chicken inn a baking dish and sprinkle to taste with
  salt, pepper and sweet paprika. With a brush, coat the chicken lightly with
  some of the remaining oil. Place in an oven that has been preheated to 200
  C/390 F and baste occasionally wit oil and the pan drippings. The chicken
  will be ready when it is nicely reddish brown. Serve hot.
