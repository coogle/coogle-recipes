      <step>  Canola Made from rape seeds. Canola oil has a bland flavor and is good for
  cooking and salad dressings. It has approximately 6 percent less saturated
  fat than other oils.
  
  Corn Made from the germ of the corn kernel. Corn oil is almost tasteless
  and is excellent for cooking because it can withstand high temperatures
  without smoking. It is high in polyunsaturated fat and is used to make
  margarine, salad dressings and mayonnaise.
  
  Olive A monosaturated oil extracted from tree-ripened olives. Olive oils
  range from light amber to green in color and bland to extremely strong in
  flavor. Olive oil is graded according to its degree of acidity and the
  process used to extract the oil. Oil labeled "virgin" is cold pressed, a
  process using no heat or chemicals and contains low levels of acidity. Oil
  labeled "pure" uses heat and chemicals to process olive residue from
  subsequent pressings.
  
  Peanut Made from pressed, steam-cooked peanuts. Peanut oil has a bland
  flavor and is good for cooking because it doesn't absorb or transfer
  flavors. Its smoking point is slightly lower than corn or safflower oil.
  Contains 17 percent saturated fat.
  
  Safflower A clear, almost flavorless oil made from the seeds of safflowers.
  Safflower oil is a favorite for salads because it doesn't solidify when
  chilled. It has more polyunsaturated fat that other oils but lacks vitamin
  E.
  
  Sesame Made from pressed sesame seeds. Sesame oil comes in two varieties:
  light (made with untoasted sesames) and dark (made with toasted sesames).
  Light sesame oil has a nutty flavor and is especially good for frying. Dark
  sesame oil (Asian) has a stronger flavor and should only be used in small
  quantities for flavoring foods -- not cooking. Both varieties are high in
  polyunsaturated fat.
  
  Sunflower Made from sunflower seeds. Sunflower oil is pale yellow and has a
  bland flavor. It is a good all-purpose oil low in saturated fat and high in
  polyunsaturated fat.
  
  Vegetable An inexpensive and all-purpose blend of oils made from plant
  sources such as vegetables, nuts and seeds. Most vegetable oils are made
  from soybeans and are high in polyunsaturaed fat and monounsaturated fat
  but low in saturated fat.
