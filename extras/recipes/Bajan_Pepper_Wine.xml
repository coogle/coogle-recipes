  Here's a twist on the pepper booze that was posted a few weeks ago. Can't
  say I've tried it myself; I only bring back Cockspur VSOR and I'm not about
  to cut it with sherry. As for amounts, I mostly saw 12 oz bottles of rum in
  the non-tourist stores and would use that as a starting point:
  
  Remove stems from the peppers and place in a bottle, then cover with rum
  and leave for two weeks. Strain and dilute to required "hotness" with
  sherry.
