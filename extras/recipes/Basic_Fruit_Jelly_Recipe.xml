      <step>  PREPARING THE FRUIT:Wash, peel and seed the fruit if necessary. Most fruits
  are then pureed (see instructions given with specific recipes). Some fruits
  are used as they are and others are mixed with syrup from canned fruit.
  Because of their relatively neutral taste, peach and apricot syrups are
  best. They can even be mixed together. PREPARING THE MOLD AND JELLING
  AGENT: Line a small brownie pan(8x8x2-in.) with parchment paper. If using
  the jelling agent in a bottle, simply open the bottle; if using pouches,
  cut them open and stand them upright in a large jar or measuring cup so
  that they will be ready to use. COOKING THE FRUIT JELLY: In a large
  heavy-bottomed saucepan, place the fruit pulp or the fruit pulp-syrup
  mixture and the sugar. Bring to a rapid boil over high heat, stirring
  constantly with a wooden spatula. Once a full rolling boil is reached start
  the cooking time; this will be from 4 to 9 minutes, always at a rapid boil
  and stirring constantly, depending on the fruit used (specific cooking
  times are given in specific recipes). Add the butter halfway through the
  cooking time. When it is time, remove the saucepan from the heat and
  immediatly add the liquid jelling agent; stir vegorously for a few seconds
  to be sure that it is completely mixed into the jelly mixture. TO MOLD, CUT
  AND SERVE THE FRUIT JELLIES: As soon as the jelling agent has been stirred
  in, pour the boiling hot fruit jelly into the brownie pan. Allow to set and
  cool completely, which will thke at least 2 to 3 hours. When the jelly is
  completely cold, run the blade of a knife all around the edge of the pan.
  Unmold and remove the paper; then cut it into squares about 3/4 inch on a
  side. Roll the squares one at a time in granulated sugar (preferably large
  grained). This step is not absolutely necessary; it does, however, keep the
  jellies from sticking to one another if piled on top of each other when
  served, and makes them more attractive. The fruit jellies can be placed in
  individual paper cases and served in a wooden box or a basket, or they can
  simply be piled on top of each other on a plate. TO STORE: The uncut
  jellies will keep for two months wrapped in the nonstick parchment paper it
  is molded on, placed in a box and kept in a cool cellar or refrigerator. If
  kept in a refrigerator the jelly picks up a little moisture but keeps its
  shine better. Once cut and rolled in sugar, the jellies will keep for a
  week in a closed container in the refrigerator. It is preferable to place
  them in individual paper cases if they are to be stored this way, to keep
  them from sticking together. These homemade fruit jellies are much softer
  than commercial ones.
