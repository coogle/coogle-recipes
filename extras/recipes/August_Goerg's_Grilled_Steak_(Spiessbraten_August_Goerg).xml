      <step>  ((Note:  Per Horst Scharfenberg, this recipe originated in the town of
  Idar-Oberstein in the 19 th century, when gemstone prospectors returning
  from South America created their own version of gaucho-grilled steaks. The
  dish was then further refined by Scharfenberg's mentor August Goerg. K.B.))
  
  Per person: thick, trimmed
  
  Mix together the shallot or onion with the pepper and mace. Insert a few
  shallot pieces into the steak using the point of a small knife.  Coat the
  steak with the shallot mixture, pressing it in so it will adhere.
  
  Remove the loose shallot pieces and grill the steak (over a fire of oak
  logs, says August Goerg, from which the bark has been removed).*  Take the
  steaks off the grill while they are still pink inside.  Sprinkle them with
  salt.
  
  *Note:  A special grill is used, suspended with 3 chains from an iron
  tripod and constantly swinging through the flames.
