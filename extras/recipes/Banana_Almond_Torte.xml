  In a large bowl, with an electric mixer beat the yolks and they are thick
  and pale. Gradually add the sugar, beating until the mixture is very thick.
  Beat in the lemon juice and the rind, add the bananas, the matzah cake
  meal, the almonds and the salt and beat the mixture until it is combined
  well. In a clean dry bowl, with clean dry beater beat the whites until they
  just hold stiff peaks, stir 1 cup of them into the banana mixture and fold
  in the remaining whites gently but thoroughly, Pour the batter into an
  ungreased 9" tube pan (3-1/2" deep) with a removable bottom and bake the
  torte in the middle of a preheated 350 oven for 55-60 minutes, or until a
  tester comes out clean.
  
  Invert the pan over the neck of a bottle and let the torte cool upside
  down. Run a thin knife around the edge and tube of the pan and remove the
  side of the pan. Run the knife under the bottom of the torte to release it
  and transfer the torte carefully with 2 spatulas to a serving plate.
  
  I hope you enjoy this as much as I have.  Sandi in CT 03/19 09:21 pm
