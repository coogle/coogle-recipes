      <step>  The fillets should be the same thickness so they cook in the same amount of
  time. The packets can be prepared several hours ahead and refrigerated
  until ready to cook.
  
  Combine coconut milk, ginger, sugar, lime juice, fish sauce and salt in
  small dish.
  
  Center each fillet on aluminum foil and bring up sides of foil close to
  edges of each fillet. Top each fillet with 3 tablespoons coconut milk
  mixture and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon mint. Fold together edges of foil to
  make 4 airtight packets.
  
  Place packets in single layer on baking sheet. Bake at 450 degrees until
  fish is cooked through, about 18 minutes for 1-inch-thick fillets. Serve
  hot, at room temperature or chilled.

  Tip -- Called nam pla in Thai, nuoc mam in Vietnamese, petis in Filipino
  and tuk trey in Cambodian, fish sauce is the salt brine in which fish have
  been pickled. It has a loud fishy aroma and, in small quantities, it gives
  an indispensable authentic flavor to many Southeast Asian dishes. You can
  find fish sauce at Asian grocery stores and sometimes in the Asian sections
  of supermarkets. -- AM
  
  GOOD COOKING: An Asian Meal for All Seasons. ** MENU * ASIAN FISH PACKETS *
  THIN NOODLES WITH CARROTS, GREEN ONIONS AND CILANTRO * ORANGE CAKE WITH
  ORANGE SYRUP ** I've adapted these recipes for grouper in coconut milk and
  noodles with carrots from some dishes I tried at LE COLONIAL, A SMALL
  INDOCHINESE RESTAURANT IN ST. BARTH'S IN THE FRENCH WEST INDIES. ** This is
  a most appealing, upbeat meal. And although I like these dishes served hot,
  they are also good served at room temperature or chilled in hot weather.
  Snow peas make an excellent addition to the plate. ** A warm orange cake
  served with warm orange syrup from Maya's, a restaurant perched right on
  the water's edge, is a delicious finish for the meal. For a more festive
  appearance, serve sliced, sugared strawberries or raspberries on the side.
  ** Mandel is a cookbook author. Her latest book is "Celebrating the
  Midwestern Table" (Doubleday &amp; Co., 1996).
