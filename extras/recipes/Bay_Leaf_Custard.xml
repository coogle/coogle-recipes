  1. Lightly oil six 7- to 8-ounce capacity heat-proof cups. Set cups on
  trivet in steaming vessel, add hot water to come up to bottoms and leave on
  stove.
  
  2. Heat milk and bay leaves to simmer in heavy saucepan over medium heat.
  Turn heat to low and simmer uncovered until reduced to 3 1/2 cups, about 20
  minutes. Remove leaves, rinse and wipe clean. Set 1 fresh leaf or  1/2 a
  dried leaf in bottom of each cup, shiny side down. Set steamer over medium
  heat.
  
  3. Combine eggs, egg white and Worcestershire in measuring cup. If not 1
  cup, make up difference with more egg white. Turn into mixing bowl and
  whisk until blended, beating in as little air as possible (bubbles make
  holes in finished custard). Slowly pour through fine wire mesh strainer
  into clean bowl. Whisk in pepper and salt. Stir while pouring mixture into
  cups to keep pepper grains distributed. Pour gently, so leaf stays in
  place.
  
  4. Lay foil over cups and cover vessel tightly. Steam, water barely
  simmering, until a metal skewer emerges clean just inside edge of cup, 17
  to 20 minutes. Center should quiver slightly (eggs will continue cooking
  once out of steamer). Cover cups loosely with foil and refrigerate. May be
  unmolded after 4 hours or next day. When cool, cover cups tightly.
  
  5. To unmold, run thin knife around custard, against sides of cup. Set
  small dish on top, turn over. If custard doesn't slip out, hold cup in
  place and whack gently but firmly on counter. Scrape any custard off leaf,
  remove scraps of custard and pour about 1 tablespoon caramelized sugar
  syrup over top.
  
  CARAMELIZED SUGAR SYRUP:
  
  1. Cook sugar in a broad skillet (preferably non-stick) over medium heat,
  shaking skillet frequently, until sugar melts completely and turns rich
  amber, about 5 minutes. Do not allow to get darker, or syrup will be
  bitter. Remove from heat and cool 1 to 2 minutes.
  
  2. Add  1/2 cup boiling water, stirring with wooden spoon. Cook over low
  heat, stirring, until hardened caramel melts-be patient. Turn into
  measuring cup and add water to make 1/2 cup. Refrigerate in tightly covered
  jar.
