      <step>  This basic recipe was from Anna Ellis (DMSD70C). I
  substituted oil for the margarine and with some
  experimentation, came up with this technique: Put all
  ingredients in the B/M and set on the dough cycle.
  When the cycle is complete, leave the dough in the pan
  for 3 to 4 more hours. Remove dough and squeeze out
  gases. Cover with a damp towel and let it rest for 20
  or 30 minutes minutes. Sprinkle corn meal on a board
  and shape dough into two cylindrical loaves. Place
  loaves on a cornmeal covered baking sheet. Cover again
  with the damp towel and allow to rise for another two
  hours. At the end of two hours, refrigerate the dough,
  still covered, for at least 12 hours (the longer the
  better). Take dough out of the refer, sprinkle with
  water, and let it sit out for 4 hours. Sprinkle again
  with water then bake at 375 for 30 minutes or until
  brown and crusty.
