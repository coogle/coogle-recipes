      <step>  To remove garlic odor from your hands, rinse your hands with fresh lemon
  juice or scrub with a bit of salt, then rinse with cool water.
  
  To freshen your breath after eating garlic, chew on a sprig of fresh
  parsley.
  
  The longer you cook garlic, the milder it becomes. When sauteing garlic, be
  careful not to burn it. Burned garlic will have a bitter taste, so discard
  it and start again.
  
  To store garlic, keep bulbs in a cool, dry place. Do not refrigerate.
  Garlic needs air circulation so don't store in a plastic bag. A small
  wicker basket can keep garlic conveniently and attractively on a kitchen
  countertop, ready to use.
  
  How to buy garlic? Look for garlic bulbs that have plump, firm cloves with
  the papery outer sheath intact. Avoid garlic that is soft, spongy or
  shriveled.
