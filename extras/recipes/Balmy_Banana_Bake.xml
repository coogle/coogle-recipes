      <step>  This recipe calls for slightly underripe bananas because, as they
  cook, they'll soften up quite a bit. Lime juice keeps the bananas from
  discoloring, so they are easily made ahead through step 3. The sweet
  and tangy combination is just right served after your jazzy meal.
  
  1. Preheat oven to 375'F.
  
  2. Butter a shallow baking dish; reserve remaining butter.
  
  3. Peel and layer bananas in the buttered dish and drizzle with lime
  juice.
  
  4. Sprinkle with sugar and dot bananas with remaining butter. Bake
  for 30 minutes, basting once or twice with sauce. Remove bananas from
  dish carefully with a long spatula. Serve hot, with sauce spooned on
  top.
