      <step>  * Such as cultivated white, cremini, yellowfoot, chanterelle, hedgehog, or
  black trumpet
  
  1. Heat butter and oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Season beef
  with salt and pepper. Sear meat in two batches on all sides until well
  browned, about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove meat with a slotted spoon and set
  aside. Add onions and cook, stirring constantly, until well caramelized,
  about 5 to 7 minutes.
  
  2. Return meat to pot, and add stock. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and
  simmer for 1 hour. Add bouquet garni, barley, and vegetables, and simmer
  for 1 hour, adding more stock if necessary. Adjust seasonings.
  
  NOTES : The addition of exotic mushrooms to flavorful homemade beef stock
  turn a familiar favorite--beef barley soup--into a special winter meal.
  Serve with crusty bread, a robust red wine, and a salad, and you'll have a
  deliciously comforting meal . Cultivated white button mushrooms are the
  type commonly found in most supermarkets. However, wild mushrooms such as
  the ones used in this soup, are increasingly available. Look for cremini or
  Italian brown mushrooms, which look like a darker version of the white
  variety, but are light tan with an earthier flavor. Black trumpet mushrooms
  are trumpet-shaped, as the name implies, and mildly fragrant. The
  yellowfoot is a golden, trumpet-shaped variety. Pumpkin-colored
  chanterelles possess a delicate, nutty flavor. The oddly named hedgehog
  mushroom get its name from the tiny spines under its cap.
