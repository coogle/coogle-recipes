      <step>  Pack 2 pint jars tightly with the violets.  Pour the vinegar (unheated)
  over the violets.  Cover tightly and allow to stand in a sunny window for 4
  or 5 days; the violets will bleach out and the vinegar become a marvelous
  pale lavender.  Strain and keep refrigerated.
  
  NOTE:  The original recipe called for cider vinegar, but to capture the
  delicate color and flavor of the violets, I use Japanese rice vinegar,
  which is not as strong or as dark as cider vinegar.
