    <directions>
      <step>  Soften yeast in warm water. In mixing bowl, combine sugar, butter, salt and
  milk. Cool to lukewarm. Stir in egg and yeast. Gradually add flour to form
  a stiff dough.
  
  No-Knead Method: Cover; let stand in warm place until doubled, about 1 to
    1-1/2    hours. Toss on well-floured surface until no longer sticky.
  
  Knead Method: Knead on floured surface until smooth and satiny, 5 to 8
  minutes. Place in greased bowl, turning dough to grease all sides. Cover;
  let rise in warm place until doubled, about 1 to 112 hours.
  
  Turn out on floured surface. Shape as desired for one of the following
  recipes.
  
  Notes: This cookbook was acquired at a junk sale. It captured my interest
  because of the annotated comments beside the recipes. The original owner
  had made comments or just check marks beside certain recipes. I will
  include these as I scan. This one had no rating.
