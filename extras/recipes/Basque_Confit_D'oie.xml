    <directions>
      <step>  ( preserved goose in it's own fat )
  
  Cut up goose, cutting thighs and back into two parts, and breast into four.
  Remove wing tips and set aside.( Save for stock or soup )
  
  Put fat (goose and pork) into large Dutch oven with 1/2 cup water and cook
  on low heat until all fat has rendered.Discard scraps. Mix together salt,
  herbs, and spices (excluding garlic).Rub goose pieces with salt mixture,
  using entire amount. Put pieces in heavy plastic bag, close tightly, and
  refrigerate for 2 days, turning bag often. Remelt fat. Wipe goose pieces
  dry and put them in the melted fat in Dutch oven.Add garlic and weight meat
  down with heavy plate.Put Dutch oven on very low heat and cook very slowly
  for 1 1/2 hours.
  
  Pour 1 inch of cooking fat into the bottom of a clean dry crock and allow
  fat to harden.Pack partly cooled pieces of goose into crock and then strain
  cooking fat over pieces. A thick layer of fat should cover the pieces of
  goose and there should be no air spaces between meat pieces.Cover tightly
  and refrigerate.Keeps up to 1 year.
  
  A pice of confit ( with a little of the fat) is good added to a stew or
  casserole as a flavor booster. It is also good served, in small portions,
  warmed over low heat, and poured over mashed potatoes or rice.
