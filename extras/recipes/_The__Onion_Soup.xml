    <directions>
      <step>  Melt the butter and olive oil together in a heavy, 4-quart soup pot. Add
  the onions, cover, and cook over low heat for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring
  occasionally.
  
  Raise the heat to moderate, uncover pan, and add sugar and salt. Cook 20 to
  30 minutes longer, stirring frequently, until the onions have turned a
  rich, mahogany brown.
  
  Reduce heat to low, add the garlic, and cook 1 minute. Blend in the flour
  and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the
  heat and blend in 1 cup of hot stock, making sure the flour is completely
  dissolved. Stir in the remaining stock, the wine, vinegar, thyme, and
  pepper, and bring to a boil. Lower heat and simmer slowly, cover slightly
  ajar, for 30 minutes. Add bay leaf the last 15 minutes, discarding it at
  the end of cooking time. Taste for seasonings and adjust as needed.
  
  NOTE: The soup can be prepared several days in advance (in fact, it
  improves with age), but if you are planning to serve it gratinee, have your
  guests clamoring at the table as you remove it from the broiler, or the
  crust will sink like a leaky barge. Therefore:
  
  Preheat the broiler.
  
  Smear a bit of butter in the bottom of individual earthenware (or other
  heatproof) bowls, and place them on a cookie sheet. Place a croute on the
  bottom of each bowl and sprinkle generously with Gruyere. Repeat this
  procedure in each bowl. Ladle in the simmering soup. Float another croute
  on top of each serving, sprinkle on more Gruyere and a drift of Parmesan.
  Drizzle with a bit of melted butter, and whisk the bowls under the
  preheated broiler for a few minutes. Watch carefully. When the cheese is
  crusty and the soup bubbling, serve immediately.
  
  AFTERTHOUGHTS: Serve the soup with bruschetta or garlic croutons. Try
  bruschetta smeared with a little dijon mustard and topped with Brie in
  place of the Gruyere croutes. If you're feeling like a high roller, add a
  dash of Cagnac to each serving when you ladle on the soup. If you're
  concerned about your weight, serve the soup unadorned except for a
  sprinkling of fresh minced parsley. Pass thin bruschetta or lightly toasted
  French bread and a small bowl of grated Parmesan at the table.
  
  You may also wish to serve the soup from a tureen. Preheat oven to 425
  degrees F, and bake for about 30 minutes, or until brown and crusty.
  
  And do try the redoubtable Julia Child's version: a couple of egg yolks
  beaten with 4 or 5 tablespoons of port or Madeira, poured under the edge of
  the crust, and gently stirred just before serving. (Divide this amount
  among bowls if serving them individually.)
