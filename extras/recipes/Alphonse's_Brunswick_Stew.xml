      <step>  Here in the South, Brunswick stew and/or Burgoo have long been
  traditionally served alongside barbeque. Since it's been so cold here on
  the east coast this past week, I thought I'd share some Brunswick Stew and
  Burgoo recipes from the Bubba-L archives to pass the time. Y'all
  enjoy--they're good!
  
     As a fellow Southron "shivering" in this inhospitable Northern iceland
  (why go to Reyjavik when you can have it all here?), I want to pass on to
  you one of my Brunswick Stew recipe to fortify you before grading student
  papers, prepare lectures, and such. Starting way in advance, poach one 4 lb
  chicken. Then add a 2 lb rabbit that's been quartered (if you don't find
  any in your backyard by all means substitute veal) and put on high heat and
  then simmer with the chicken with additional water to cover. You should add
  the rabbit some 35 minutes after having poached the chicken. When done,
  drain, reserve the stock and cool the meats on a platter. Once the meats
  are cool enough to touch with your fingers, bone the chicken and the rabbit
  and chop into bite-size pieces. Return the chicken and rabbit morsels into
  the stockpot and add a Virginia ham bone (if you got one) along with 2 cups
  of sliced onions, 2 cups of chopped celery, 1 cup carrots, and 2 cups of
  sliced cabbage. Add garlic, marjoram, 2 bay leaves, and a little dash of
  cayenne (optional). Stir in 2-3 lbs of chopped tomatoes with juice, bring
  to a boil, then simmer for 25 minutes. Add 1 lb of lima beans, 1 1/2 lbs
  chopped potatoes, and 4 cups of corn. Bring to a boil again and then
  simmer, stir the pot a bit to prevent burning. This will take another hour.
  Season with salt and black pepper. An option is to sprinkle finely chopped
  parsley into the pot. You can serve this on a bed of rice, or with biscuit,
  or, as I like to do, with fresh baguettes. A nicely tossed salad with
  vinaigrette dressing would be a nice accompaniment to your stew. Choose a
  good, full-bodied red wine to serve with your stew and you and your guests
  can tell winter to do its worst.
