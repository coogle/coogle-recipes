  A salad or vegetable platter is a very important part of a Vietnamese
  meal; indeed, it is served at practically every one.  The vegetables,
  which are eaten along with many dishe, are arranged on a platter, and
  diner helps himself to whatever he desires.  In Vietnam we used many
  more vegetables and herbs than we can find in the West.  But, in
  spite of that, the following platter makes a satisfactory
  accompaniment to the dishes we have prepared for this book.  All
  vegetables and herbs are those served in Vietnam, except that the
  variety is smaller.
  
  Arrange a mound of lettuce in the center of a platter.  Around the
  lettuce, and touching it, arrange separate mounds of mint and
  coriander.
  
  Arrange the cucumbers in overlapping slices around the complete outer
  rim of the platter.
  
  This is the basic arrangement of the vegetable platter.  On those
  occasions when a recipe calls for another vegetable, it can be added
  to this platter.
  
  Makes 8 servings.
