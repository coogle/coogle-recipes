      <step>  folding in one third of the dry mix and then the rest of the buttermilk and
  coffee, plus the vanilla extract. Finally, fold in the remaining dry mix.
  
  5.Spoon the batter into the muffin cups, filling each cup only halfway.
  Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, or until a tester inserted into the center of a
  cupcake comes out clean. When cool enough to handle, transfer the cupcakes
  to a wire rack and cool completely.
  
  Make the chocolate frosting:
  
  1.Place the chocolate in a medium bowl. In a small saucepan, set over
  medium heat, bring the cream to a boil. Pour the hot cream over the
  chocolate. Let the mixture stand for 30 seconds to melt the chocolate.
  Gently whisk until smooth. Let the frosting cool and thicken slightly
  before icing the cupcakes.
  
  2.Spread a thick layer of frosting onto each cupcake. Sprinkle the top of
  each cupcake with the toasted, chopped macadamia nuts. To serve, place a
  cupcake in the center of each dessert plate. Arrange 3 small scoops of the
  mango ice cream around each cupcake and garnish with mango slices.
