  Recipe By: Adapted from Dr. Atkins' New Diet Cookbook
  Melt butter in non-stick omelet pan or skillet. Cover pan well with butter
  as it melts. Beat eggs with remaining ingredients. Pour into pan and tilt
  to spread eggs to edges. Cook over low heat. Loosen eggs from sides of pan
  with spatula as they begin to set. Lift eggs with spatula and tilt pan to
  allow uncooked eggs to run to sides and under eggs to continue cooking.
  Carefully lift one side of outer edge of eggs with spatula and fold over
  towards center making a half circle or flattened cone. Slide omelet out of
  pan onto dish and serve. If filling omelet, spoon filling mixture on top of
  and in the center of omelet prior to folding edges over to form half
  circle.
