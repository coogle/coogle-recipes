    <directions>
      <step>  Chop yellow bell peppers and onion and mince garlic. In a 3 to 4-quart
  heavy saucepan cook yellow peppers, onion, and garlic in 1 tablespoon oil,
  covered, over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until peppers are
  soft, about 30 minutes. Stir in cream. In a blender puree mixture in
  batches (use caution when blending hot liquids), transferring to a large
  bowl, and season with salt and pepper. Sauce may be made 2 days ahead and
  chilled, covered. Bring sauce to room temperature before proceeding.
  
  Thinly slice mushrooms lengthwise and cut red and orange bell peppers into
  1/4-inch wide strips. In a deep large heavy skillet cook mushrooms and
  peppers in remaining 2 tablespoons oil over moderately high heat, stirring
  occasionally, until peppers are softened and most of liquid is evaporated,
  about 8 minutes, and season with salt and pepper.
  
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Fill a 6 to 7 quart kettle three fourths full
  with salted water and bring to a boil. Stir in ziti and cook until just
  tender, about 10 minutes. Reserve 1 cup pasta cooking water and drain ziti
  well in a colander. Rinse ziti and drain well. Thinly slice scallion
  greens. Into sauce stir ziti, mushroom mixture, scallion greens, 1 1/2 cups
  Parmesan, reserved cooking water, and salt and pepper to taste. Spoon
  mixture into a 3 quart shallow baking dish and sprinkle with remaining 1/2
  cup Parmesan. Bake ziti in middle of oven until hot and pasta begins to
  brown, about 20 minutes.
  
  Yield: 8 to 10 servings
