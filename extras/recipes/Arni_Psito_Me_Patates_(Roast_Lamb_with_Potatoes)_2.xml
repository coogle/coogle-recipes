      <step>  Just in case you haven't noticed, a traditionally Greek Easter is an event
  whereby the guests primary goals are to eat and eat and drink themselves to
  exhaustion. After all, it's a celebration of great magnitude and like most
  big holidays, draws guests and family members together for a day or two,
  from far and wide.
  
  Now if you're one of those cooks that doesn't happen to have an open-fire
  spit in your back garden, have no fear. We've updated today's recipe to be
  prepared in the oven. However, feel freely to dig the pit and prepare the
  spit if you so desire. Cooking time is about a day-and-a-half!
  
  To prepare the marinade, finely chop 8 cloves of garlic and place in a pan
  that is large enough to hold the lamb. Add 2 Tbs. oregano, 2 Tbs. rosemary,
  6 Tbs. olive oil, 1 cup lemon juice, wine or apple juice, and salt and
  pepper to taste. Mix thoroughly and place the lamb in the marinade, turning
  to coat well on both sides. Cover and set aside in the refrigerator
  overnight.
  
  Crush 6 cloves of garlic and the remaining oregano and rosemary together
  with a mortar and pestle or chop them finely and combine thoroughly. Season
  with salt and pepper.
  
  Pre-heat oven to 375-F degrees. Remove lamb from marinade and pierce in a
  dozen places with a paring knife. Rub the garlic and herb mixture all over
  the lamb, pressing the mixture firmly into the cuts with your fingers. Coat
  surface of the lamb with about 4 Tbs. olive oil.
  
  Mix remaining olive oil and lemon juice together in a bowl. Crush remaining
  garlic and place in a large roasting pan and add potatoes. Place lamb on
  top of the potatoes and roast, basting frequently with the lemon mixture
  and turning the potatoes occasionally, for 1 hour and 45-minutes. Remove
  lamb from the oven and let rest for about 10-minutes, keeping potatoes warm
  in the oven that you turned off when you removed the lamb. Carve leg of
  lamb and serve with potatoes.
