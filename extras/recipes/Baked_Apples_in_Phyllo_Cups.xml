  phyllo covered with damp cloth. Lightly spray each sheet with nonstick
  cooking spray. Stack sheets. Cut into 6 squares. Stack squares in 2 stacks,
  3 squares each. Cover with damp cloth. Repeat.
  2. Press stacks, sprayed-side down, over outside of 4 inverted 6-ounce
  custard cups. Place on rimmed baking sheet.
  3. Bake in preheated 375'F. oven 8-10 minutes until golden brown. Remove to
  rack to cool. Remove phyllo cups from custard cups. (Cups can be made up to
  2 days ahead; store in airtight container at room temperature.)
  4. Reduce oven temperature to 350'F. Core apples from stem end, leaving
  bottom intact. Pare skin from top third of apple. Place apples in small
  baking dish.
  5. Combine sugar, walnuts, cinnamon. Stuff into cored centers. Allow any
  overflow to fall into baking dish. Pour reserved syrup over apples.
