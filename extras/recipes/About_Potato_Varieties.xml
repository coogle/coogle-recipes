      <step>  Check the state of origin on the bag to see if you have Michigan boilers or
  an off brand Idaho baker. For boiling, I like Michigan (plain old brown
  potatoes), red (thin skinned), and Yukon Golds - and those lovely new red
  potatoes in the spring!  For baking, Idaho or russets.  For mashing,
  russets. I know there are lots of neat varieties out there that I haven't
  seen, please let us all know about them!
