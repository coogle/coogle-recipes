  Place ripe bananas, 1 per serving, directly into the freezer unpeeled. The
  peel will serve as a protection in the freezer. Freeze solid.
  
  Just before serving, peel off the skin with a small paring knife ( a little
  trickier than it sounds), cut the banana into chunks &amp; place in a blender
  or in a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Blend until the banana
  breaks up, passes the icy stage &amp; becomes creamy &amp; whipped with air. The
  consistency should be that of frozen custard.
  
  Serve immediately.
  
  Notes: Variation: Frozen berries, peaches etc. can be added, but for best
  results it should be at least half banana.
