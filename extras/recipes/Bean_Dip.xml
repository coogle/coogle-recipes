    <directions>
      <step>  drain freshly cooked hot beans and toss into food processor with remaining
  ingredients.  Process until cheese is melted and mixture is smooth.  Taste,
  adding additional vinegar and or seasoning to taste.  Serve hot with chips
  or tortillas.
  
  Serves well in a cock pot or bean pot heated in an oven at 350 degrees for
  30 minutes. The heavy ceramic hold heat and keeps the dip warm longer.
  
  Can also be used as a sandwich filling or burrito filling.

  NOTES : Beans can be pinto, red, pink, kidney.  Black beans also work well
  Green Chilis are optional.  Use Jalapanos if there are chili heads to be
  fed. Cheese can be cheddar, colby, jack, etc. Fetta works well as does
  mixed cheeses. Vinegar amount can vary from 1 to 4 tablespoons depending on
  the amount of chili Tobasco and chili powder are optional (for
  not-chili-heads) I like a chipolte chili or two in this for heat and flavor
  Author noted that family thought there was something wrong with the flavor
  of the dip, but could not identify it until the dip was gone -- and what
  was wrong was the dip was gone.
