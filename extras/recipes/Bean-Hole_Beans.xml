      <step>  Put dry beans in a lg. iron pot, cover w/ water, and hang over a fire; boil
  5 min, stirring constantly. Remove from fire, and add pork, molasses,
  mustard, and salt. Cover w/ closely fitting cast-iron cover. In dry ground,
  preferably gravel, dig a hole 2 ft. deep and 2 ft. across, and in it build
  a brisk hardwood fire. When the fire has burned to coals, take part of the
  coals out w/ a shovel; place iron pot in the hole and cover w/ the
  remaining coals.  On top of the coals, place the gravel originally taken
  from the hole. Leave the pot in the hole all day. Colonial Cookbook,
  updated as researched from the Old Farmer's Almanac, 1792.
