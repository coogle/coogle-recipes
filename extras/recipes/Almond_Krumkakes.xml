    <directions>
      <step>  Cream together butter and powdered sugar; beat well. Add by degrees egg
  whites, almonds, flour and vanilla. This version can also be used to make
  Chinese fortune cookies. COOKING INSTRUCTIONS:
    You will need a krumkake iron, which fits over a 7-inch burner surface
  (gas or electric).  Always use moderate heat.
    For each baking period, the iron should be lightly rubbed at the
  beginning with unsalted butter, but after this initial greasing, nothing
  more is required. The batter needs a preliminary testing, as it is quite
  variable, depending on the condition of the flour, so do NOT add at once
  all the flour called for in the recipe. Test the batter for consistency by
  baking 1 teaspoonful first. The iron is geared to use 1 tablespoon of
  batter for each wafer, and it should spread easily over the whole surface
  but should not run over when pressed down. If the batter is too thin, add
  more flour.  Should any batter drip over, lift the iron off its frame and
  cut off the excess batter with a knife run along the edge of the iron.
    Cook each wafer about 2 minutes on each side or until barely colored. As
  soon as you remove it from the iron, roll it on a wooden spoon handle or
  cone form, and, when cool, fill it.
