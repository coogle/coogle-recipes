  In a large mixing bowl combine 2-1/2 cups flour and yeast.  Heat water and
  salt in a saucepan 'til warm to the touch (110 F) Mix water into flour to
  form a dough. Knead for 10 - 12 minutes until smooth and elastic (earlobe
  consistency), adding remaining flour as necessary to make a barely sticky
  dough.
  
  Form the dough into an 8 inch long cylinder, and cut it into 8 equally
  sized pieces. Form each piece into a smooth ball (try to remove any seams
  by rolling it between your hands. Poke your thumb through the center of
  each piece and twirl it between your index fingers to make a hole.
  
  Place uncooked bagels on a floured cookie sheet and allow to rise 20 to 30
  minutes in a warm place until doubled in bulk. (gas oven with the pilot
  light on, electric oven with light on, sunny window or countertop next to
  warm oven) Preheat oven to 375F (400F if you want a thicker crust). In a 4
  qt pot boil 8 cups water and 1/2 tsp salt.
  
  Drop bagels, 3 at a time into the boiling water.  Cook uncovered 3 - 5
  minutes over high heat, turn once with a slotted spoon.  Remove bagels and
  transfer to a well oiled or floured baking sheet.
  
  Bake at 375F for 25-30 minutes or 400f for 20 minutes until firm to the
  touch.  Cool on racks.  Enjoy.
  
  Variations:
  
  1. Garlic bagels: add 3 cloves minced garlic, 1 tbsp onion flakes to dry
  ingreds.
  
  2. Herbed bagels: add 2 tsp dried  mixed herbs.
  
  3. Millet bagels: substitute 1 cup millet meal or flour and 1-1/2 to 2 cups
  spelt or whole wheat bread flour in the basic recipe.
