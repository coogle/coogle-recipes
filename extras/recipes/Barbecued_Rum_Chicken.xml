    <directions>
      <step>  In small bowl combine all ingredients except chicken. In large resealable
  plastic food bag place 2/3 cup marinade; add chicken. Tightly seal bag.
  Turn bag several times to coat chicken well. Refrigerate, turning
  occasionally, at least 4 hours or overnight. Refrigerate remaining marinade
  in separate covered container. Prepare grill, placing coals to one side;
  heat until coals are ash white. Make aluminum foil drip pan; place opposite
  coals. Remove chicken from marinade; discard marinade. Place chicken on
  grill over drip pan. Grill, turning once, until chicken is no longer pink
  (15 to 20 minutes). Meanwhile, in 1-quart saucepan cook remaining marinade
  over medium heat until mixture comes to a full boil (2 or 3 minutes).
  Continue cooking until slightly reduced (7 to 8 minutes). Drizzle over
  chicken.
  
  Broiling Directions. Prepare chicken as directed above. Broil 4 to 6 inches
  from heat until chicken is no longer pink (12 to 14 minutes). Continue as
  directed above.

  Technique: Indirect cooking on the grill heats the food evenly from the
  sides rather than from the center. If using a charcoal grill, open all the
  vents, divide charcoal briquets evenly and arrange them in the grill,
  leaving space in the center. Light the coals. When they are ash white,
  place a foil drip pan between the coals and put the cooking grate in place.
  Set the food on the center of the grate, then put the lid on the grill.
  Don't lift the lid or turn the meat unless the recipe instructs.
