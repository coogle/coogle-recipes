  Mix and blend the milk sugar/honey and salt.  Add and beat well the eggs.
  You should add the egg white, beaten to firm peaks, last.  Finally add the
  flavorings, vanilla extract and/or nutmeg.  Don't use much nutmeg it is
  quite stong in the custard. Also don't beat it too much or you will kill
  the egg white.
  
  When it is all incorporated, pour it into a baking pan (for individual
  servings use individual custard cups)  Place the pan in a pan of warm water
  and bake at 300-325 degs for about an hour.
  
  Testing custard is abit tricky.  after about an hour slip a knife between
  the edge of the custard and the pan.  It should be clean.  The center
  should still be soft. It will continue to cook for a bit after you take it
  out. If you suspect that the center is done too much put the pan in a pan
  of cold/ice water to stop the cooking process. You can use the knife test
  to see if it is too doine in the middle.
