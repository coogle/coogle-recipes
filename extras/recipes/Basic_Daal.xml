    <directions>
      <step>   Pressure cook about two fistfuls of mung beans with water adding 1/4 tsp
  turmeric powder to it.  (I usually put one fistful for one person if daal
  is not the main dish in the meal. Otherwise , you might want to add two
  fistfuls per person. It is probably surprising, but this measuring scheme
  works for me)
  
   Once cooked, stir the beans till they can no longer be seen separately.
  This step is very important. If the beans are nicely cooked, just a stir of
  the spoon will make a smooth paste. This is the reason why we are pressure
  cooking the beans. It is not only faster, but also cooks the beans
  thoroughly. Cooking in a pan is possible, but be prepared to keep stirring
  for about an hour.
  
   Also, if more water is required, add after the daal has been cooked.  For
  those who have tried this dish, know what consistency they need.  For
  others, daal should be pouring consistency. Add salt.
  
   If you like garlic, fry crushed garlic in little bit of butter or oil and
  add to the daal along with the puree. May also want to add ginger, though I
  give it a miss (don't like the taste, you know). Let this cook (on the
  stove, not press. cook).
  
   Seasoning:  Mustard seeds, cumin seeds and slit green chillies in butter
  or oil. (First add mustard seeds. Wait till they burst, add cumin seeds and
  green chillies. Do not fry green chillies for too long, as they will lose
  their flavor) Add to daal at the very end. Garnishing: Lotsa chopped
  coriander leaves.
  
   Note:  To make it fiery, why not add little bit of cayenne pepper powder.
