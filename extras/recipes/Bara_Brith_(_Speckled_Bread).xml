      <step>  This is Wales' traditional rich fruit bread.  South Wales makes it with
  baking powder; Northerners prefer yeast as the raising agent. Either way
  it's delicious.
  
  Soak the dried fruit and sugar overnight in the tea. You can use either
  fresh tea, or the cold dregs from the teapot (this gives a good strong
  colour).  Next day, sieve the flour and fold it it into the fruit. Mix in
  the lightly beaten egg.  Line a small loaf-tin with buttered paper then tip
  in the mixture, smoothing it well into the corners.
  
  Bake in a gentle oven at 300 F (150 C) gas mark 2 for 1 1/2 hours. Cool and
  store for at least 2 days in a tin so that it matures moist and rich.
  Traditionalists say you should never butter the Bara Brith, but Dorothy
  says do, as it's lovely that way.
