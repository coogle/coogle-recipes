  This is a low-fat version I just made last night.  Use 5-6 pounds of tart
  cooking apples such as pippins or Granny Smiths.  Put 1/2 cup fresh lemon
  juice in a large pot. (Not an aluminum one.) Quarter, peel, and core
  apples. Put in pot. Cover. Cook on very low heat, stirring occasionally,
  for 1 hour (until apples turn to mush). You can use a potato masher on them
  if you want smooth applesauce. You can also stir in 1/3 to 1/2 cup sugar at
  the end if you want it sweet. That's it.
