      <step>  [The original author's general directions for pizza dough-making are quite
  lengthy and explicit; I include here only a portion of the general
  
  directions for bread machines and for making dough by hand. Her directions
  
  are more detailed, and include specific instructions for using dough
  makers, food processors, and heavy-duty mixers with dough hooks. I highly
  recommend the cookbook for any pizza-lover!]
  
  If using a bread machine, add the ingredients in the order specified for
  your particular machine. If your machine has a double kneading cycle,
  remove the dough after an hour of rising and turn off your machine;
  allowing the dough to knead a second time causes bubbles which are
  difficult to roll.
  
  If making by hand, proof the yeast in 1/4 to 1/3 of the water with a pinch
  of sugar. Then add the remaining liquid ingredients, mix well, then add the
  dry ingredients and stir until you can no longer work the dough with a
  spoon. Turn the dough out onto a well-floured counter, knead for 5 to 10
  minutes, and allow to rise covered in a warm place for 50 to 60 minutes.
  
  =46or a thin-crust pizza, roll the dough out 1/8 inch thick; slightly
  thicke= r at the edges. Turn the edges up slightly to prevent run-off in
  the oven, and place toppings no closer than 1/4 inch to the edge of the
  dough, preferably no closer than 1/2 inch.
