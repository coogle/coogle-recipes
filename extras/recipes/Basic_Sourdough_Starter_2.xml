    <directions>
      <step>  Dissolve yeast in warm water in 3-qt glass bowl. Stir in milk. Stir in
  flour gradually. Beat until smooht. Cover with towel; let stand in warm,
  draft-free place until starter begins to ferment, about 24 hrs. (bubbles
  will appear on surface of starter) If starter has not begun fermentation
  after 24 hr, discard and begin again. If fermentation has begun, stir well;
  cover tightly with plastic wrap and return to warm, draft-free place. Let
  stand until foamy, 2-3 days. When starter has become foamy, stir well; pour
  into 1-qt crock or glass jar with tighlty fitting cover. Store in frig.
  Starter is ready to use when a clear liquid has risen to top. Stir before
  using. Use 1 c starter in recipe; reserve remaining starter. Add 3/4 c milk
  and 3/4 c flour to reserved starter. Store covered at room temp until
  bubbles appear, about 12 hrs, refrigerate. Use starter regularly, every
  week to 10 days. If the volume of the breads you bake begins to decrease,
  dissolve 1 t yeast in 1/4 c warm water. Stir in 1/2 c milk, 3/4 c flour and
  the remaining starter. *DO NOT USE SELF RISING FLOUR* NOTE: Start bread at
  night to bake in the morning - or vice versa. Before adding the milk and
  flour to remaining starter, bake your bread and judge the volume
