      <step>  SOURCE: SPAGO, W. SUNSET BLVD; LOS ANGELES.  RAYMOND CABERNET SAUVIGNON,
  1978.  SAUCE: Combine sugar and 1/2 cup water in heavy saucepan. Cook on
  medium heat 15-20 minutes, until sugar turns light golden brown. Don't let
  sugar burn.  Remove saucepan from heat, immediately add cream, stirring
  until smooth.  Add butter, let melt in sauce. Stir to combine thoroughly.
  Serve warm or chilled.  If not using at once, cover with plastic wrap,
  store in refrigerator. ICE CREAM: In 3-quart bowl, whisk egg yolks together
  with sugar. Set aside. Pour milk and cream into saucepan, add split vanilla
  bean. Heat just to boiling point to scald, then remove pan from heat. Pour
  a little scalded milk and cream into egg mixture, stir gently. Gradually
  add and mix in remaining milk and cream. Return pan to stove, cook over
  medium to low heat, stirring constantly until mixture coats wooden spoon.
  Strain into bowl over ice.  Stir in Caramel Sauce. Freeze in ice-cream
  maker, according to directions.
