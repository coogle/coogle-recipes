    <directions>
      <step>  Freeze meat until firm but not hard; then cut into 1/8 to 1/4-inch-thick
  slices.
  
  In a medium-size glass, stoneware, plastic or stainless steel bowl, combine
  soy sauce, Worcestershire, onion powder, pepper, garlic powder, and liquid
  smoke.  Stir to dissolve seasonings.  Add meat and mix until all surfaces
  are thoroughly coated. Cover tightly and refrigerate for at least 6 hours
  or until next day, stirring occasionally; recover tightly after stirring.
  
  Drying the jerky:  Depending upon the drying method you're using, evenly
  coat dehydrator racks or metal racks with cooking spray; if oven drying,
  place racks over rimmed baking pans.
  
  Lift meat form bowl, shaking off any excess liquid. Arrange meat strips
  close together, but not overlapping, on racks.
  
  Dehydrator drying:  Arrange trays according to manufacturer's directions
  and dry at 140-degrees until a piece of jerky cracks, but does not break,
  when bent (8 to 10 hours; let jerky cool for 5 minutes before testing).
  
  Pat off any beads of oil from jerky.  Let jerky cool completely on racks;
  remove from racks, place in a rigid freezer container, and freeze for 72
  hour.  Then store in airtight, insectproof containers in a cool, dry place;
  or freeze or refrigerate.  Makes about 3/4 pound.
  
  Storage time:  Up to 3 weeks at room temperature; up to 4 months in
  refrigerator, up to 8 months in freezer.
