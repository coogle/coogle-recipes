    <directions>
      <step>  1. Wrap a slice of bacon around each breadstick.
  
  2. Place wrapped breadstick in a microwave baking dish. Small microwave
  ovens may require making several batches. Times will very according to your
  oven and the size of the dish you are using; small batches take about 5
  minutes, large ones, about 10 minutes.
  
  For the conventional oven, you can precook the bacon and then wrap around
  breadsticks just before warming them up.
  
  Servings: 2 per person.
