      <step>  Preheat oven to 400F. Trim the beef tenderloin of fat and skin. Cut the end
  and wrap the meat with 4 thin slices of pork fat lenghwise. In a large
  saute pan, heat the oil until very hot and saute the meat on all sides.
  Season with salt and black pepper. Let the meat brown slightly. Place in
  the hot oven for 15 to 20 minutes for rare to medium. (20 minutes if beef
  is hot 25 minutes if beef is room temperature. See note Remove from oven
  and let rest at room temperature or in a lukewarm place for 15 minutes
  before carving. This is important to allow the juices concentrated in the
  center to permiate all around the meat. SPECIAL NOTE; you can sear this 2
  to 3 hours ahead of the roasting time.
