    <directions>
      <step>  1.  In food processor, combine basil, parsley, garlic and pine nuts.  Pulse
  until finely minced.  Add cheese and process to blend.  With machine
  running, drizzle oil through feed tube until desired consistency is
  reached.
  
  2.  Transfer to small bowl and cover with plastic wrap (press directly to
  surface to prevent discolouring).  Alternatively, cover surface with thin
  film of oil or place pesto right into plastic bag.  Store in fridge for up
  to 1 week. Tip: If you only have curly parsley, use 1/2 cup
  
  Per tbsp:

  To freeze pesto.  Prepare as above, omitting cheese and using smaller
  amount of oil.  Place in freezer container, covering surface with film of
  oil or in freezer bags.  Ice cube trays may also be used - once frozen,
  transfer to freezer bag.  Will keep in freezer up to 6 months.  Thaw in
  fridge, not in microwave.  Stir in cheese after thawing.  (Tip - to perk up
  colour after thawing, stir in 2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley)
  
  Variations. Instead of pine nuts, use other kind of nuts. Toast first to
  enhance flavour. For lower-fat version, reduce oil to 1/4 cup and add 2 tsp
  lemon juice and 1/2 cup chicken stock. Or, replace some of the oil with
  sun-dried tomatoes. Use immediately. Use half Parmesan and half romano
  cheese Use roasted instead of fresh garlic.
