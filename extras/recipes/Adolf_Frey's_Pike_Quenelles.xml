      <step>  Author's note: Adolph Frey owns one of the few Michelin-rated 2-star
  restaurants in Germany. He made this dish at the lodge for Carl's birthday
  celebration 1 year. Quenelles are poached fish-&amp;-egg mounds traditionally
  made w/pike.
  
  To make quenelles, grind pike in food processor, or use a tamis if you have
  one. Set aside.
  
  Bring water to a boil. Sift in flour &amp; stir until water is absorbed. Keep
  stirring so that mixture doesn't stick to pan. Remove from heat &amp; beat in 1
  egg. Cool mixture, then refrigerate until cold. Remove mixture from
  refrigerator &amp; blend it in food processor until smooth. This is the panade.
  
  Cream butter in small bowl. Put ground pike in bowl that is set inside
  another bowl of ice. Season w/salt &amp; pepper, mix in panade, &amp; gradually add
  other whole egg &amp; all egg yolks. When blended well, add butter. This can be
  done in food processor if all ingreds are kept cold. Chill mixture for 30
  mins.
  
  To make white sauce, place chicken stock in heavy saucepan over medium
  heat. Bring to simmer, then reduce heat &amp; continue to simmer on low until
  stock is reduced down to 1 cup liquid, abt. 45 mins.
  
  In large saucepan over med. heat, reduce cream until it begins to thicken,
  whisking occasionally.
  
  whisk thickened cream into stock, adding more or less cream, deepending on
  desired consistency. Season w/salt &amp; pepper to taste. Strain sauce through
  a fine-mesh sieve, if desired. Makes 2 cups.
  
  To assemble dish, shape quenelles by mounding mixture between 2 warmed
  spoons. Set each quenelle on floured surface.
  
  Preheat oven to 400F. Butter baking dish large enough to hold quenelles. In
  wide saucepan, bring 3 qts water to a boil &amp; poach quenelles for 15 mins
  w/o letting water boil. Drain thoroughly. arrange quenelles in prepared
  baking dish.
  
  Nap quenelles w/enough white sauce to cover. Sprinkle w/Parmesan. Bake for
  15-20 mins, unti cheese browns. Serve 2-3 quenelles per diner.
