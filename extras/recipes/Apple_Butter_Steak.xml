    I know that this sounds like I'm pushing it, but one of my former cooks,
  Scott, came running over with this recipe and told me I had to try it. I
  think he developed it when he came home one night and found little in the
  pantry except apple butter. What do you think could have caused him to come
  up with such a recipe? Interesting that he always has soy, sherry, and
  fresh ginger on hand. It is really quite good.
  
    Place the steak on a plate. Mix the remaining ingredients together and
  rub 2 tablespoons onto the steak, both sides. Allow to marinate for 1/2
  hour and then broil on an oven rack to your liking. I enjoy mine a bit
  rare. Turn once. Slice the steak across the grain of the meat and place the
  pieces in an oven-proof dish. Pour the remaining sauce on top of the meat
  and place under the broiler for just a few moments, thus allowing it to
  glaze a bit.
  
    This is delicious served with Rice with Cheese and Onions (see recipe).
