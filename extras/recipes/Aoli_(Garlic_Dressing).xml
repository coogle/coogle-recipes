  Aoli (Garlic Dressing)  (Base recipe by Frugal Gourmet: Jeff Smith)
  
  Pedro's Spanish Alioli below reminded me of the greek version of this
  recipe; which is essentially garlic mayonaise/salad  dressing.  You can add
  chiles or Sriracha for a dip/bread spread for fast  garlic bread, etc.
  
  Blend/whip 1 egg at room temperature add garlic (pressed) into blender
  blend and slowly add olive oil; till emulsion turns white/whipped-will look
  like mayonaise stir in juice of 1/2 lemon or 1 lime (if you've got the
  really big ones, taste after adding 1/2 amount) Use for potato salad, salad
  dressing, cold chicken salad, garlic bread, Keep Refrigerated!
  
  Note: no salt was added to base recipe, as this was to be a blood-pressure
  friendly recipe; the natural aolin(?sp)  from the garlic, along with the
  olive oil has been known to help blood pressure and heart stress.  You may
  add salt, chiles, spices as desired to create effect as desired.
