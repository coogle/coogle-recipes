      <step>  Preheat the oven to 400F.  Mix all of the ingredients together, except for
  the flour.  Add the flour slowly to the rest of the mixture until it
  reaches the right consistency to roll out.  The dough should be quite soft.
  (You may find it easier to knead it with your hands.) Roll out on a floured
  surface to a thickness of about 1/4 inch and cut into decorative shapes
  with small cookie cutters, a sharp knife or the rim of a glass. Place on a
  greased baking sheet and bake in the oven for about 8 minutes. Remove from
  the oven while they are still soft and cool on a rack, then pack into
  crocks or jars.
  
  The authors note that the Pennsylvania Dutch settlers made these at
  Thanksgiving and stored them in a stoneware crock until Christmas. The
  cookies can be made at any time, but allowed to age for 4-6 weeks. They can
  be used as a substitute for graham crackers for a pie crust.
