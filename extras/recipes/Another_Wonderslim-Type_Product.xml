  market billing itself as a butter substitute for baking:
  
  "Just Like Shortenin'" is made from prunes, apples, and water (no
  lecithin).  Product of The Plumlife Company, 15 Orchard Park, Madison, CT

  Label says "Just Like Shortenin' is good enough to eat with a spoon. Try
  that with your current shortening!"
