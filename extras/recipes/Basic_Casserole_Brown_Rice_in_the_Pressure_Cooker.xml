      <step>  (From:Great Vegetarian Cooking Under Pressure by L.J. Sass)
  
  In a 1 1/2 or 2 quart casserole, combine all the ingredients. Place the
  rack and 2 cups of water in the cooker. Lower the uncovered casserole onto
  the rack with the aid of a foil strip. Lock the lid in place. Bring to high
  pressure and cook for 20 minutes (for long grain brown, Wehani, brown
  basmati) or 25 minutes (for short grain brown). Allow the pressure to come
  down naturally for 20 minutes. Remove the lid. If the rice is not quite
  tender, replace (but don't lock) the lid and allow it to steam for a few
  more minutes. Lift the casserole with the aid of the foil strip. Fluff up
  rice before serving.
  
  This has always worked for me except that I have to cook it a few minutes
  longer because of altitude. In fact, it's the only way I can cook it
  without having a really bad pan to clean up.
