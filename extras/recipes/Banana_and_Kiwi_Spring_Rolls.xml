      <step>  Somehow I don't think these are exactly what you're looking for. But these
  are good recipes, so I'm taking the opportunity to post them anyway. These
  all came from a cookbook I cannot recommend enough, The Terrific Pacific
  Cookbook.
  
  Cut a banana in half lengthwise. Place one banana, cut side up, on your
  work surface, and on it position 3 to 5 of the kiwi slices (or as many as
  will fit without overlapping the slices). Top with the other banana half.
  Holding the banana firmly, cut it in half crosswise. Repeat with the
  remaining banana and kiwi. Place a spring roll wrapper on the work surface
  with a corner facing you. Place a stuffed banana half horizontally across
  the middle of the wrapper. Sprinkle the banana with 1 1/2 teaspoons of the
  brown sugar. Fol dthe bottom corner of the wrapper over the banana and tuck
  it under. Fold in the sides and roll the banana almost up to the end. Brush
  the top corner with a little egg white, roll up and press firmly to seal.
  Prepare the rest of the rolls in the same fashion. Pour oil to a depth of 2
  inches into a wok or deep skilled and heat over medium-high heat to 375.
  Fry the rolls, three at a time, until deep golden, about 4 minutes. Turn
  several times during the frying process. Using tongs or a slotted spoon,
  transfer to a double layer of paper towels to drain. Repeat with the rest
  of the rolls. Place the rolls on individuals plates, sprinkle with
  confectioners' sugar. If you like, top with a dollop of Coconut-Rum or
  other whipped cream. Serve at once. Posted to TNT - Prodigy's Recipe
