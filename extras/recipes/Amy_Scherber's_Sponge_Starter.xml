      <step>  Mix all the ingredients together in a medium bowl and stir vigorously with
  a wooden spoon for 2 to 3 minutes, until a smooth, somewhat elastic batter
  has formed. The batter will be very stiff; it gets softer and more elastic
  after it has proofed. You may find it easier to mix the sponge using
  electric mixer, with a paddle or a dough hook, on medium speed for 1 to 2
  minutes. Scrape the sponge into a 2-quart clear plastic container and cover
  with plastic wrap. At this point you have two options:
  
  If you plan to make your dough later that same day, let the sponge rest at
  room temperature until it has risen to the point where it just begins to
  collapse. This may take from 6 to 8 hours, depending on the temperature of
  the sponge, the temperature of the room, and the strength of the yeast. The
  sponge will triple in volume and small dents and folds will begin to appear
  in the top as it reaches its peak and then begins to deflate. The sponge is
  now in perfect condition to be used in a dough. It's best if you have
  already weighed or measured out all of your other recipe ingredients before
  the sponge reaches this point so you can use it before it collapses too
  much.
  
  If you're not planning to make your dough until the next day or the day
  after, put the covered sponge in the refrigerator and let it rise there for
  at least 14 hours before taking it out to use in a recipe. Be sure to
  compensate for the cold temperature of the starter by using warm water (85
  to 90 degrees) in the dough instead of the cool water specified in the
  recipe. Or let the starter sit out, covered, until it reaches room
  temperature (this may take several hours)-but don't let it collapse to much
  before you use it.
