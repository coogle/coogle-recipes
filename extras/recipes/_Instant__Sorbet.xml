    <directions>
      <step>   Take a can of juice-packed peaches or pineapple. Freeze it for several
  hours.  (That's right, just put the can in the freezer!) Open and dump
  frozen contents into food processor with metal chopping blade in place or
  into a blender.  Process until desired consistency. Enjoy!
  
  Note: You can also do this with frozen bananas.  I find this is a good way
  to use them this time of year when they get over-ripe so quickly. Freeze
  them* in "zip-lock" type bags - peeling them when frozen can give you
  frostbite!  They end up very creamy--like very rich ice cream...but with no
  added fat,sugar, etc... *w/o peels
