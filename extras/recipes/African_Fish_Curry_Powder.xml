      <step>  Curry powders are an important part of African cooking due to the heavy
  influence of Arabic and Indian cuisine in Africa. Curry powders are made
  from different proportions of spices, dried and ground. Spices can be dried
  in the sun for two to three days, in a low temperature oven, or on top of
  the stove in a dry skillet. If using a skillet be sure to shake the spices
  constantly so they don't burn. Grinding is usually done with a mortar and
  pestle. Curry powders are not necessarily hot, they are made that way by
  the addition of chili peppers. Dry spices, grind to a powder and seal in an
  airtight container. Use 2 teaspoons of curry powder to every 400 g or 1 lb
  of fish.
