  Note: Please note that these ingredients make a very runny filling that
  pleased the 12 devout Ebingerists who taste-tested different versions of
  this cake. Those who desire a less syrupy consistency can stir in an
  additional 1 to 2 tablespoons cornstarch.
  
  Recipe is from _New York Cookbook_ by Molly O'Neill.
