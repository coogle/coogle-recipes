      <step>  SS&gt; But I don't even bother buying pork chops any more, I don't want
  SS&gt; to put leather on the table.  :(
  
  Don't know if you caught my post to Marlon or not, Sylvia, but the
  problem is not with you, it's with the pork.  Now that pork producers
  are looking for a leaner, lighter product, pork requires much less
  cooking than is recommended in most cookbooks.  Most cookbook authors
  recommend cooking pork to an internal temperature of 160-175 to
  eliminate any possible danger of trichinosis (a problem that's been
  eliminated in commercially produced pork anyway).  These temperatures
  are WAY too high for the leaner version, which tends to resemble shoe
  leather if treated this way. Try cooking your chops to an internal
  temperature of 140 or so instead (still well done, but not
  overcooked), and you'll have MUCH better results.
  
  My favorite thing to do with pork chops is to stuff 'em.  Allow one
  double-thick pork chop or two thinner chops for each person you're
  feeding.
  
  Make a stuffing with cornbread (or one of the cornbread stuffing
  mixes), chopped onion, chopped celery, a small can of whole kernal
  corn, a bit of chicken broth.  Simmer the onion and celery in the
  broth until tender, and add the remaining ingredients.  Season to
  taste with salt, black pepper, a generous amount of either sage or
  thyme.
  
  If using double-thick chops, cut a deep pocket in the chop, and
  insert the stuffing.  If using thinner chops, don't stuff yet. Either
  way, melt a small amount of shortening in a frying pan, and quickly
  brown the chops (brown thinner chops on one side only).
  
  Place the chops in an oven-proof baking dish.  (If using thin chops,
  place one chop, browned side down in the dish, top with a scoop of
  stuffing, and top with another chop, browned side up).
  
  Place just enough liquid in the pan to cover the pan bottom, cover
  the pan, and bake in a 350 degree oven until the chops reach an
  internal temperature of 140 (35-60 minutes, depending on the
  thickness of the meat).
  
  Any leftover stuffing can be baked separately.
  
  I usually make a pan gravy with the drippings from browning the
  chops, plus some flour and chicken broth (pork stock would be better,
  but I never seem to have any :-).  If you don't want gravy, just
  deglaze the baking dish with more chicken stock, and spoon this
  liquid over the chops.
  
  Sorry not to offer an official recipe here, but this is one of those
  home-style dishes that I just throw together.  Have never measured
  anything for it, and I suspect it's never QUITE the same any time I
  make it. Good stuff, though.  At least it's one of Mooseface's
  favorites :-)
