  I came up with this because I don't eat dairy and wanted something to put
  on my bagels
  :-)
  
  Put all but the currants in a blender and blend until smooth.  If it is not
  thick enough, you can add a mixture of cornstarch and water that have been
  heated and thickened to the mixture.  Add soymilk if it's too thick.  I
  always have the tofu in my freezer; it doesn't *have* to be frozen first,
  but it should be well drained.
