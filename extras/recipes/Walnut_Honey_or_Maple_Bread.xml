      <step>  Try using maple syrup instead of honey.
  
  Can use olive oil instead of walnut.
  
  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Place the walnuts on a baking sheet,
  roasting until fragrant and golden brown, about eight minutes.  Cool.
  
  In a bowl, dissolve  the yeast in the water.  Allow to proof for three
  minutes.
  
  Stir the sponge, honey and oil into the water, breaking the sponge up using
  your hands or a spoon.
  
  Add 2 3/4 cups of the flour and salt and mix, scraping and folding until
  the dough gathers into a single mass.  Knead, in the bowl, until the dough
  
  becomes soft and only slightly sticky, using the additional flour gradually
  as necessary.
  
  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead the nuts into
  
  the dough until they are evenly distributed.  Place the dough in a lightly
  
  oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.
  
  Halve the dough and shape each piece into a ball and place on a
  flour-dusted kitchen towel.  Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise in a
  draft-free location for two hours.
  
  Sprinkle a baking sheet generously with cornmeal.  Gently press one of the
  
  dough balls down on a lightly floured surface and then reshape into a ball.
  Do the same with the other risen ball.  Place both balls, with the seams on
  the bottom, on the baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise
  until doubled, in a draft-free location.  This should take 2-3 hours.
  
  Preheat the oven for at least thirty minutes along with a baking stone or
  tiles on the middle rack to 425.   Place a baking pan with decent sides on
  
  the bottom shelf.  Boil two cups of water.   Using a razor blade, make an
  'X' in the top of each of the loaves.  Pour the boiling water into the
  baking pan.   With a quick jerk, slide the loaves off the sheet and onto
  the stone.
  
  Bake for (20??) 30-35 minutes until the loaves are hollow sounding when
  tapped on the bottom.  When done, cool on a rack.
