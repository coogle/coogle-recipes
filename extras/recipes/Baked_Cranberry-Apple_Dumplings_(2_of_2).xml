      <step>  Form pastry into ball; wrap in waxed paper; refrigerate. On waxed paper,
  combine 2 tablespoon sugar &amp; the cinnamon. Pare and core apples; roll in
  cinnamon-sugar; reserve any left over. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Butter
  13-by-9-by-2-inch baking pan. On lightly floured pastry cloth, roll pastry
  into a rectangle 30 by 4-1/2 inches. With pastry wheel or knife, cut
  lengthwise into 4 strips. Starting at the top, 1 inch from center, spiral a
  pastry strip around each apple, over- lapping slightly, covering
  completely. Moisten overlapping edges with cold water; press edges to seal.
  Press sides and bottoms of pastry against apples. Place in baking dish,
  sides not touching. Spoon melted butter into centers. Brush pastry with egg
  yolk mixed with 2 teaspoons water. Sprinkle with reserved cinnamon-sugar.
  Bake 15 minutes; reduce oven to 350 degrees. Brush pastry again with egg
  yolk. Continue baking dumplings 20 to 30 minutes longer, or until apples
  are tender when pierced with knife and pastry is crisp and golden.
  Meanwhile, make cranberry-apple sauce: In medium saucepan, combine
  cranberries and sugar. Mash cranberries slightly with spoon. Add maple
  syrup and 1/4 cup water; mix well. Bring to boiling, stirring, about 3
  minutes, or until cranberries pop. Add chopped apple and butter. Bring to
  boiling; reduce heat, and simmer, covered, 5 minutes. Remove apples to
  serving dish. Spoon sauce over top and around base of each. Serve warm with
  vanilla ice cream or whipped cream. Makes 4 servings. Source: Mc Call's
