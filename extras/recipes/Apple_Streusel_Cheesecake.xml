      <step>    I make this cheesecake often, especially in the fall. I don't use special
  recipe, just make a plain, New York type cheesecake, but add apple pie
  spices like cinnamon and nutmeg (to taste). Then add diced fresh apples to
  taste (couple of cups usually). Then top the whole thing with a streusel
  topping (butter, sugar and a little flour all cut up together) like you
  would put on a Dutch Apple Pie and bake as the directions for the plain
  cheesecake suggest.
    It is wonderful.
