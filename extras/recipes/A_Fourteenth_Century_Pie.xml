    <directions>
      <step>  1. Make a firm short crust using some eggs with the water to mix the flour
  and a little salt; but no sugar. 2. Roll it out but not to thin, and with
  it line a tin pie mould that opens and is kept closed with a metal skewer.
  3. Put in the middle of the pie 3 young partridges (boned) and 4. round
  them put 6 fine quail boned and stuffed. 5. Round these put 12 larks,
  boned. 6. Cut a little bacon and dice and sprinkle them into the pie. 7.
  Put in some sour grapes and a very little salt. 8. And fill up with boned
  thrushes ans other small birds. 9. Put in neither spice, nor cheese nor
  water. 10. Ornament the top crust; make a hole in the middle; brush it over
  with yolk of an egg, and bake in a very moderate oven for several hours
  according to size.  Meantime make some good clear nicely flavoured game
  stock that will be a firm jelly when cold; strain it, and directly the pie
  comes from the oven pour it, hot, into the pie by means of a funnel placed
  in the hole in the middle of the lid.
  
  NB - This pie may be eaten hot or cold.  For a ball supper it will of
  course be eaten cold.
