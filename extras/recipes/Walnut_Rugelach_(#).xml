      <step>  Prepare Basic Holiday Cookie dough, with the following changes: Substitute
  3 ounces cream cheese for 3 Tbsp. margarine; decrease sugar to 1/4 cup and
  baking powder to 1/4 tsp; substitue 1 egg yolk for whole egg, (reserving
  white for filling). Divide dough into thirds; shape each into disk. Wrap in
  plastic and refrigerate until well chilled. Meanwhile, prepare filling:
  Beat egg white until frothy. Mix in 1 cup ground walnuts and 1/2 cup sugar.
  Roll out each dough disk to 6 1/2 to 7" circle. Spread one-third of filling
  on each circle, leaving 1/4 inch border around edge of circle. Cut into 12
  wedges. Roll up each wedge from edge to point in center. Place, point side
  down, on ungreased baking sheets. Bake in 350 F. oven 12-14 minutes or
  until lightly browned. Cool on wire racks. Dust with confectioner's sugar.
