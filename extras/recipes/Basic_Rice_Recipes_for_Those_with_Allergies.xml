      <step>  Over 100,000 people are unable to eat foods from grains such as wheat,
  barley, rye and oats; others may also react to millet and buckwheat.
  This condition is known as Celiac Sprue Disease and is basically a
  problem of malabsorption.  The primary treatment calls for the omission
  of any product that contains certain proteins, namely gluten.
  
  Rice, a non-allergenic food, is ideal for the gluten-free diet, and is
  suitable for most allergy diets.  An added bonus is that it's also fat,
  sodium and cholesterol free.  Rice comes in many forms including white
  and brown rice, flours, rice bran and rice oil.  It is also very
  versatile; rice can be served as a snack at any meal as an appetizer,
  entree or dessert.
  
  If you are following a special allergy diet, remember to read labels
  carefully.  Ingredients often change from one product to another, and
  even from batch to batch from the same manufacturer.  If the label is
  not clear, you can write or call the manufacturer (look on the label)
  for specific ingredient information.
  
  We hope you find these recipes, and the accompanying information
  helpful.  All of the recipes are wheat-free.
  
  For those who are also sensitive to milk and eggs, suggestions for
  substitutes are given on the following page.
  
  When wheat and wheat flours are not used in baking recipes the final
  product tends to be coarser and denser.  Here are some hints for making
  better foods, and some ingredient substitutions if you are also avoiding
  milk and eggs.
  
  SUGGESTIONS
  
  * Include brown rice flour and rice bran in soups, casseroles and baked
  goods to add more fiber.
  
  * Add dried fruits, nuts or chocolate chips to batters to improve
  flavor and moisture-retaining qualities of baked goods.
  
  * Bake gluten-free items in smaller sizes - like cupcakes, muffins, and
  biscuits; bake quick breads in mini loaf pans for better texture.
  
  SUBSTITUTIONS
  
  * Thicken sauces, gravies and cream pies with rice flour.  Use the same
  amount of rice flour as wheat flour. Whisk rice flour and liquid
  together and heat over medium heat until bubbles first appear for a
  smoother mixture.
  
  * Combine dry cream of rice or dry crushed rice cereal with dried herbs
  and spices to make a tasty breading for fish, meat, or poultry.
  
  * Substitute _one_ of the following for each cup of wheat flour in
  recipes:
  
  :           7/8 cup brown or white rice flour (1 cup minus 2 Tbsp.)
  :           5/8 cup potato flour (1/2 cup + 2 Tbsp.)
  :           1 cup soy flour + 1/4 cup potato starch
  :           1 cup corn flour
  :           1 scant cup fine cornmeal
  
  * Use Rice Dream or Amasake, pure rice liquids; or Eden Soy,
  Lacto-Free, Tofu White (all contain soy); NutQuik (made from almonds)
  to use in place of milk.  Several infant formulas are made from a
  base of soy or corn, check the labels to be sure they fit your needs.
  
  * Replace milk with fruit or vegetable juices; and experiment with
  yogurt; many people who are allergic to milk are able to tolerate
  yogurt and other cultured dairy products.
  
  * Add EggBeaters (found in the refrigerated egg section and in the
  freezer case) or EggReplacer (free of egg, dairy, corn, soy and
  gluten) a dried product, to replace eggs and lower fat and
  cholesterol in recipes.
  
  * Use buttermilk or yogurt in place of milk for lighter finer-textured
  products.
