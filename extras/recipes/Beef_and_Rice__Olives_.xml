    This dish comes from a cookbook that is about 200 years old. I cannot
  quite figure out the background of the name but we have seen the dish many
  times since those early days. It is obviously a way of stretching meat
  using rice. I have added some seasoning and the dish is baked, so it is
  easy to prepare.
  
    Mix all together and form into 1-inch balls. Place on a baking sheet and
  bake for about 20 minutes at 375Ã¸, or until they are done to your taste.
  
    If you make these small enough, they are terrific as party snacks. Larger
  sizes fit the dinner table well, along with a green salad, rolls, and
  perhaps some Cabbage and Salt Pork (see recipe).
