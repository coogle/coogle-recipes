      <step>  Aglio Olio Peperoncino (garlic oil with peppers)
  
  I offer a simple recipe which I have cooked about once a week for the last
  12 years. It's a derivative of the Italian "Aglio Olio Peperoncino," garlic
  oil with peppers. &lt;Eileen&gt; ebanderson@ualr.edu
  
  Put pasta water on to boil. Peel and slice the cloves of one head of
  garlic. Slice 5-7 jalapenos into rounds. I leave the seeds in. Saute the
  garlic and peppers in about 1/2 cup of cheap olive oil (NOT extra- virgin;
  it can't take the heat). Saute to preference: practically raw, soft, or
  garlic turning golden. If you like the latter, give the garlic a head start
  on the peppers. Boil 1 lb dry pasta: spaghetti is traditional but shells or
  penne are good too. Start grating lots of Parmesan cheese. You know the
  rest: drain the pasta well, mix the pasta and oil mixture, pile on the
  cheese, eat. Hard-core heads will want to use habs, probably. I've had good
  results with serranos and tiny Asian peppers. Just don't used dried; the
  dish needs the sweetness of fresh peppers, IMO. Note to the purists: this
  is a bastardization. Italians don't generally put Parmesan cheese on aglio
  olio, and would probably not cook with these types of hot peppers. Too bad.
