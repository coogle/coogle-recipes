      <step>  SINCE ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE DECREASES AS ALTITUDE INCREASES, THE
  REQUIREMENT FOR BAKING SODA ALSO DECREASES.  BAKERY MIXES ARE FORMULATED
  FOR
  USE AT SEA LEVEL AIR PRESSURE.  A REDUCTION IN THE SODA CONTENT OF MIXES AT
  HIGHER ALTITUDES IS EASILY ACCOMPLISHED WITH MIXES CONTAINING A SEPARATE
  SODA
  PACKET.  IF THE SODA PACKET IS NOT LABELED WITH INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE AMOUNT
  OF SODA TO BE USED AT DIFFERENT ALTITUDES, USE THE FOLLOWING AS A GUIDE:
  2000 FEET --- USE 80 % (4/5 OF PACKAGE)
  4000 FEET --- USE 66 % (2/3 OF PACKAGE)
  6000 FEET --- USE 55 % (1/2 OF PACKAGE)
  8000 FEET --- USE 35 % (1/3 OF PACKAGE)
  WHEN PREPARING CAKES, HOT BREADS, AND DROP COOKIES FROM BASIC
  INGREDIENTS AT HIGH ALTITUDES, QUANTITIES OF LEAVENING AGENTS MAY BE
  ADJUSTED
  AS SPECIFIED IN THE TABLE ON THE BACK OF THIS CARD.
  CAKES HAVE A TENDANCY TO STICK TO PANS AT HIGHER ALTITUDES; THEREFORE,
  THE PANS SHOULD BE GREASED AND DUSTED MORE HEAVILY THAN THOSE USED AT SEA
  LEVEL.
  OVEN TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE INCREASED 25 DEGREES F. AT ELEVATIONS OF
  3500 FEET OR MORE.  THE BAKING TIME IS GENERALLY THE SAME AS AT SEA LEVEL;
  HOWEVER, CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN TO AVOID OVERBAKING SINCE EVAPORATION RATE
  INCREASES AT HIGHER ALTITUDES.
  BAKING POWDER OR BAKING SODA IN RECIPES FOR CAKES, HOT BREADS, AND DROP
  COOKIES PREPARED AT HIGHER ALTITUDES SHOULD BE DECREASED AS FOLLOWS:
