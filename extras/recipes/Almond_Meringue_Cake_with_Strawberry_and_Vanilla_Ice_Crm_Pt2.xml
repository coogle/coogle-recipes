  NOTES : If you have any meringue left after piping the two disks, make a
  few dessert shells.  To soften the ice cream, place it in the refrigerator
  about thirty minutes before needed.  And remember,not all of the ice cream
  is needed at the same time.  If you need ice cream softened in a hurry, you
  can also microwave it on the defrost setting, checking it every thirty
  seconds at first, and then every fifteen seconds as it reaches the softened
  state.
