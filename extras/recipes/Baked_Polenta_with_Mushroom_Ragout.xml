  From: Manzanita &lt;manzana@dorsai.org&gt;
  Here's one from Gourmet magazine a few years back--I made this recipe a
  couple of times--I substituted shitake mushrooms with Portobellos--yum!
  It's worth the prep time! I didn't do the star thing that the recipe calls
  for, I just made the top layer smooth. I have to also finish transcribing a
  good one from Bon Apetit this month,--a delicious roasted vegetable
  casserole with a polenta top--I'll send that to you soon, too. But for now
  try this one!!
  
  Make the mushroom ragout: In a large deep skillet cook the onion, the
  garlic, and the rosemary in the oil over moderate heat, stirring, until the
  onion is softened, add the mushrooms and salt to taste, and cook the
  mixture over moderately high heat, stirring, for 10 minutes, or until the
  liquid the mushrooms give off is evaporated. Stir in the tomato paste and
  the wine and boil the mushroom mixture until most of the liquid is
  evaporated. In a small bowl stir the cornstarch into the broth, add the
  mixture and the Worcestershire sauce to the mushroom mixture, and bring the
  ragout to a boil, stirring. Simmer the ragout for 2 minutes and season it
  with salt and pepper.
  
  In a large heavy saucepan bring the water with the oil to a boil and add 1
  cup of the cornmeal, a little at a time, stirring constantly.  Reduce the
  heat to low, add the remaining 1 cup cornmeal in a slow stream, stirring
  constantly, and bring the mixture to a boil. Remove the pan from the heat
  and stir in the butter, 2/3 cup of the Parmesan, the parsley, and salt and
  pepper to taste.
  
  Spread one third of the polenta evenly in a buttered 13- by 9-inch baking
  dish and chill the polenta sheet for 20 minutes, or until it is firm. While
  the polenta is chilling, working quickly, spread half the remaining polenta
  in a buttered 3-quart shallow baking dish, top it with half the mushroom
  ragout, and top the ragout with the mozzarella. Spread the remaining
  polenta quickly over the mozzarella and top it with the remaining ragout.
  
  Invert the polenta sheet onto a work surface and with 1 or more star-shaped
  cutters cut out as many stars as possible. Arrange the stars decoratively
  on the ragout and sprinkle them with the remaining 1/3 cup Parmesan. The
  layered polenta may be prepared up to this point 2 days in advance and kept
  covered and chilled.
  
  Preheat the oven to 400Ã¸F. Bake the layered polenta in the upper third of
  the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the polenta stars are golden.
  
  NOTE: The recipe did NOT call for any cornmeal! I assume from the
  instructions that 2 cups is what is needed....Glen
