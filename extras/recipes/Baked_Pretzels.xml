      <step>  Add yeast, salt, bread flour, egg substitute, and 1/2 cup water in the
  order suggested by the bread machine manufacturer and process on the dough
  cycle. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly spray baking sheet with nonfat
  cooking spray. When the dough cycle is complete, remove dough and place on
  lightly-floured surface. Roll dough into 12x4-inch rectangle and cut into 8
  (12-inch) strips. Pull each strip to about 14 inches in length. Form dough
  into pretzel shape: Make a circle; cross the ends at the top, twist the
  ends once and lay over the bottom of the circle. Pretzel logs can also be
  shaped just by making rolled dough into a 12- to 14-inch rope. Place
  pretzels on prepared baking sheet. In a small bowl, combine egg white with
  1 tablespoon water and brush on pretzels. If desired, sprinkle pretzels
  with coarse salt, sesame, or poppy seeds. Bake in preheated oven 15 to 20
  seconds. Serve with mustard or cheese dip. Source: "Recipes for Fat-free
