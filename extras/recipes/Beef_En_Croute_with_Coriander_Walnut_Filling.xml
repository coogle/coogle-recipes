    <directions>
      <step>  Trim tenderloin if necessary and pat dry. Halve tenderloin crosswise and
  season with salt and pepper. In a large heavy skillet heat oil over
  moderately high heat until just smoking and brown beef, 1 piece at a time,
  on all sides, about 2 minutes total for each piece of beef, transferring to
  a platter.
  
  Make an egg wash by lightly beating egg with water. On a lightly floured
  surface with a floured rolling pin roll out pastry into a 19 by 15-inch
  rectangle (slightly less than 1/4-inch thick). Cut a 1-inch strip of dough
  from a shorter end (leaving an 18 by 15-inch rectangle) and reserve strip.
  Arrange rectangle lengthwise on a baking sheet or tray (about 17 1/2 by 12
  1/2-inches), letting excess hang over. Spread one third filling lengthwise
  down middle of rectangle, forming a 16 by 2-inch strip. Arrange beef pieces
  end to end lengthwise on filling and spread remaining filling on top of
  beef. Brush edges of dough with some egg wash. Fold up long sides of dough
  to enclose beef completely and seal edge. Fold ends of dough over wrapped
  beef and seal edges. Invert a large baking sheet onto wrapped beef and
  invert beef onto sheet so that pastry is seam side down. Brush crust evenly
  with some egg wash. Cut out holly leaves and berries from reserved pastry
  strip and arrange on crust, gently pressing to make them adhere. Brush
  decorations with some egg wash and with a sharp knife make small steam
  vents every 3 inches on top of crest. Chill beef en croute, loosely
  covered, at least 1 hour and up to 6.
  
  Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Bake beef en croute in middle of oven 45
  minutes, or until pastry is golden brown and a thermometer inserted
  diagonally 2 inches into center of beef registers 115 degrees. Let beef
  stand on sheet on a rack 25 minutes. Beef will continue to cook as it
  stands, reaching 125 degrees (medium rare).
  
  Yield: 16 servings
