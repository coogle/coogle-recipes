      <step>  Cook beans until tender. That's about 20 minutes in the pressure cooker
  (what a marvel of technology!). Obviously, a lot longer if you don't have
  one. You could use canned beans too, if you wanted to be quick about it.
  
  Add potatoes and celery and cook until potatoes are tender. In the pressure
  cooker that takes anywhere from 2-8 minutes, depending how finely you chop
  the potatoes. I cut mine into large cubes and it took about 4 minutes (but
  I live at 5500, so adjust accordingly).
  
  Salt to taste.
  
  Saute onion until browned. Mix in with beans and potatoes.
  
  If you like it hot, a shot or two of hot sauce would be good. Extremely
  filling!!!!

  you have a pressure cooker. That's what I used and you can go from dried
  beans to dinner table in about an hour. :
