      <step>  Saute some sliced mushrooms (say a cup or so), in a teaspoon or so of
  butter.  Or sweat the mushrooms after sprinkling with butter flavor or
  butter extract.  Take a 1-1/2 quart ovenproof dish and add 1-1/2 cups
  washed pearl barley.  Add 2 cans (about 3-3/4 c) stock (see note below).
  Add the mushrooms, deglazing the pan with a bit of the stock. Bake,
  covered, in a medium oven (350-375 deg F) until the barley is tender
  (notice that barley never gets soft--it's more like al dente, there's a
  little resistance, but no starchy core) which takes about an hour or so,
  depending on the age of the barley, etc.  Add more stock if it dries out
  before it's done, but don't drown it.
  
  Optional extras--sweat a little minced garlic, a clove or two, in a little
  broth until it softens.  Do the same with chopped onion, about 1/4 to 1/2
  cup.
  
  Broth note--I use beef-flavored boullion because the flavors of beef and
  barley go very well together--this dish is very "meaty" and satisfying. You
  can certainly use any good broth, as long as it's not too salty. There are
  quite a few good vegetarian beef-flavored broths, as well as vegetable
  flavored broths, both canned and dry. This isn't good with chicken-flavored
  broth; something about the barley just doesn't work.
  
  Two good books are Greene on Grain and Great Grains, but I think this
  recipe came from somewhere else.
