    <directions>
      <step>  Drain the capers if packed in vinegar; soak, rinse, and drain if packed in
  salt; then chop them fine.
  
  Turn the oven to 400 degrees. Remove the salmon's skin, remove any loose
  membranes, and carefully pick out all bones. Cut the fish into very small
  dice and put it in a bowl together with 2 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil, the
  chopped parsley, garlic, capers, 1 tablespoon of bread crumbs, salt, and
  several grindings of black pepper. Toss thoroughly.
  
  Wash the tomatoes, cut them in half horizontally, scoop out all the seeds
  and the centers to make a cup-like hollow. (If you are cooking anything
  else that day or the next that calls for fresh tomatoes, use the scoopings
  in the recipe.)
  
  Pat the inside of the tomatoes with paper towels to soak up excess juice,
  then stuff them with the salmon mixture, pressing it down lightly as you do
  so. There should be enough to form a mound. Sprinkle the tops with the
  remaining bread crumbs and drizzle with the remaining olive oil, holding
  back a few drops to smear the bottom of a baking pan. Place the tomatoes on
  the baking pan and bake in the upper level of the preheated oven for 35
  minutes or until the salmon stuffing has formed a light golden crust. Serve
  not piping hot, but lukewarm. They are also good later, at room
  temperature, but not reheated.
  
  Yield: 4 appetizer servings
