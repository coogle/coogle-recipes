  These can be made with or without meat. They have a different texture than
  fried egg rolls but it's worth it because I hate greasy egg rolls! Also,
  deep frying is SO messy. These were still pretty crispy!
  
  Mix soy sauce with corn starch. Set aside.
  
  Spray non-stick skillet or wok with nonstick cooking spray or heat one
  tablespoon cooking oil. Over high heat stir-fry 1-2 cloves garlic and
  ginger for a few seconds. Add cabbage, bean sprouts, carrot and green
  onions. Stir fry a few minutes until cabbage is wilted. If cooking meat,
  remove vegetables from pan.
  
  Add remaining 1-2 cloves garlic. Add ground turkey or hamburger. Stir fry
  until no longer pink. Drain off any fat.
  
  Add reserved soy sauce/corn starch and the vegetables. Cook 1 minute or so
  until thickened. Remove from heat and allow to cool a little.
  
  TO MAKE EGG ROLLS: Heat oven to 400 degrees. Spray a cookie sheet with
  nonstick cooking spray.
  
  Turn eggroll skin so it looks like a diamond. Place 1/4 cup filling just
  below the center. Fold the lower point of the diamond over the filling
  tucking it under the filling. Fold the left and right corners over that.
  Tightly roll the egg roll. Moisten the top corner with a bit of water to
  prevent it from unrolling. VOILA! Repeat til you run out of skins or
  filling. (Note: Keep the eggroll skins in their wrapper or cover with a
  moist towel so they don't dry out.) Should make at least 14 egg rolls.
  
  Place eggrolls seam side down on the pan. They can be close together but
  not touching. Lightly spray the egg rolls with the nonstick cooking spray.
  Bake 15-20 minutes until golden brown.
