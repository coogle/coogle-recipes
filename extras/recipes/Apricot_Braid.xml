      <step>    Let bread dough completely thaw. On a lightly floured surface, roll
  thawed loaf into a rectangle approximately 14 by 8". Place rectangle of
  dough on a greased sheet pan. Spread with 2 tablespoons margarine and 2
  tablespoons brown sugar (save remaining margarine and sugar for glaze).
  Drain the apricots, reserving the liquid for the glaze.
    Place drained apricot halves lengthwise down center of rectangle.
  Sprinkle with marshmallows and cinnamon. With sharp knife or scissors, cut
  dough into strips lengthwise down eachside of rectangle. Make strips 1"
  wide an 2" deep (or cut in until it almost hits the filling). Gently
  stretch each strip and criss-cross over filling.
    Let rise in warm area until puffy, 30 to 60 minutes (see note). While
  rising make glaze.
    For glaze, combine remaining sugar and margarine with reserved apricot
  syrup in a medium sauce pan. Bring to a boil. Let boil for 5 minutes.
  Remove form heat. Set aside. When twist has risen, bake in a preheated 350
  oven for 25 minutes.
    Remove from oven and brush with glaze. Return twist to oven and bake 10
  to 15 minutes longer. Remove from oven, brush with additional glaze. Remove
  twist from sheet pan to cool on a wire rack. When cool, slice and serve.
    Note: Twist can be assembled in the evening to rise in the refrigeratior
  overnight. This enables you to quickly bake it for breakfast in the
  morning. Simply brush the unrisen twist with some melted margarine and
  cover with plastic wrap to keep from drying out while in the refrigerator.
  In the morning, proceed with remaining recipe instructions.
