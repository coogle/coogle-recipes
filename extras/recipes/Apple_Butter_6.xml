      <step>  Boil cider or juice uncovered over high heat until reduced to about 2 1/2
  cups. Pare, core and thinly slice apples, measure them well packed, then
  add to liquid. Simmer uncovered over low heat, stirring often, until
  mixture begins to boil.
  
  Add remaining ingredients and continue to cook until mixture is quite
  thick, stirring often so it won't stick. When a little bit placed on a cold
  plate cools to a spreading consistency, it is ready. Pour into sterilized
  jars, cover, and keep in a cool place. Yield: 4-5 jelly glasses.
  
  NOTES : A Mennonite sweet, marvelous on toast or hot homemade bread, the
  ingredients for this are available all year around. But, for me, the very
  best apple butter is made with the first summer sour apples.
