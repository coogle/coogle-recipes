  This recipe was posted about a week ago.  They turned out great.  I really
  like this recipe because it is easy and doesn't call for anything I
  wouldn't normally have on hand, plus it's low in sugar. I have tried two
  variations that turned out just as good. I'm sorry I don't remember who
  posted this, but thanks!
  
  (Mix dry ingredients and fruit, add juice and stir just until blended.  Put
  in muffin cups and bake at 305 degrees for about 25 min.)  I always double
  the recipe.
