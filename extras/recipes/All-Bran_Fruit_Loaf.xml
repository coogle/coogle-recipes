  Soak first four ingredients together for at least 1 hour.  Mix the flour in
  well, and put into a greased lined loaf tin and bake for approximately 1
  hour at 375F.
  
  Notes: The cake is delicious, and served in slices with a little margarine
  on. If you wrap it in foil and keep for a few days (if it lasts that long)
  the flavour gets even better. The all-bran is available in the UK as
  Kellogg's AllBran. It's sort of little sticks of high-fibre bran stuff. If
  you can't get it in the US, I don't know what the equivalent is (not having
  been to the US myself).
