      <step>    This is a simple recipe that you can use to add a bit of color to the
  barbecue buffet. Purchase large shrimp in the shell and skewer them on
  bamboo barbecue sticks. Place them in your cooker when everything else is
  just about finished. They will take only a few minutes to cook and the
  smoke flavor on the shrimp is just wonderful. Be careful not to overcook
  this delicacy.
