  Tried a new recipe last night that was good, although a little ginger-y for
  our tastes. Since there are a number of ginger lovers on this list, thought
  I'd share!  From Prevention's Quick and Healthy Low-Fat Cooking
  (Mediterranean).
  
  Combine all ingredients. Bake in 8x8" baking dish at 400Ã¸F for 20 minutes.
  
  The original recipe called for 1 tablespoon olive oil and a
  non-stick-sprayed baking dish, neither of which we used. No sticking, no
  problems.
