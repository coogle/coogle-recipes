      <step>  In a large frying pan, saute the onion in the oil until it is translucent.
  Add the spices and stir for 1 minute. Add the eggplant and tomato, stir
  well and cover. Reduce heat and simmer until vegetables are mushy (about
      1/2    hour).
  
  Remove the lid and continue cooking until most of the liquid evaporates
  (about 15 minutes). The finished dish should be thick enough that you could
  use it as a dip.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Indian eggplant, onion and tomato casserole -- This is an Indian dish,
  called Baigan Bartha in Hindi.  We make it a lot and call it "Bangin'
  Bart." It is eggplant, onions and tomatoes, but not in the usual way.
  
  In this recipe, the vegetables are cooked to mush, with only a small amount
  of tomato, just enough to flavor it. Yield: serves 6-8.
  
  *  I don't make this with any spices but salt and pepper. The genuine
  Indian version of the recipe adds various Indian spices; try about 1 t of
  fresh ginger, about 1/2 t of turmeric, about 1/2 t of cayenne, and about 1
  t of garam masala for a more authentic Indian flavor.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 45 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.
