      <step>  ~------------------------------OPTIONALS ~--------------------------------
  NOTE:  TO PREWARM A CANDY THERMOMETER, SIMPLE PLACE IT AN A SMALL SAUCE PAN
  OF COLD WATER AND BRING IT TO A BOIL.  LET IT SIMMER UNTIL YOU NEED THE
  THERMOMETER. STEP 1: Prewarm the thermometer; separate the eggs allowing
  the whites to come to room temperature in a large bowl of an electric
  mixer.  (Return the egg yolks to the refrigerator covering with plastic
  wrap or water for another recipe.) Fill a glass with ice cubes and water.
  To make dropped divinities, you will need 2 cookie sheets, topped with
  greased wax paper. For squares, use a greased and wax paper-lined 8 X
  8-inch pan.  Measure the sugar, corn syrup, ice water and salt and dump
  into a heavy 2-quart saucepan with a tight fitting lid. STEP 2: Dissolve
  the sugar, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon over low heat.
   Syrup will become clear, gritty sounds will cease, and the spoon will
  glide smoothly over the bottom of the pan. Increase the heat to medium and
  bring to a boil. STEP 3: (OPTIONAL): Cover pan with a square of wax paper
  and lid, pushing down firmly.  Steam for 2 to 3 minutes to dissolve the
  sugar crystals.  (Listen to make sure the pot doesn't boil over. To
  double-check, remove lid, leaving the wax paper in place.) STEP 4: Wash
  down any crystals clinging to the sides with a brush dipped in hot water
  from the thermometer bath. Introduce the prewarmed thermometer. No need to
  stir. STEP 5:  Beat the egg whites until stiff but not dry. If your mixer
  is a heavy duty one, you can wait until the bubbles in the syrup become
  very large and airy before beating the egg whites. Otherwise, do it now
  when the thermometer registers 240 Degrees F. (115.5 C.). STEP 6: Test the
  syrup when the thermometer registers 246 degrees F. (119 C.). Continue
  testing until it reach the firm-ball stage, 246 to 260 degrees F. (119 to
  126.5 C.). Syrup will be hard to scrape up in ice water.
   It will have to be forced into a ball, but once formed, it should hold its
  shape but give under pressure. Return the thermometer to the hot water bath
  to soak clean. STEP 7:  Dribble the syrup into the egg whites in a slow,
  steady stream, beating at slow speed. Tilt the syrup pan to get the last
  drop but do not scrape the pan. Once the syrup is completely incorporated,
  change to a flat whip if you have one. STEP 8: Have patience and continue
  beating.
   The amount of time you spend mixing depends on the power of your mixer. If
  you have a heavy duty or commercial one, you can go to full speed and make
  the divinity in less than 5 minutes. With less powerful ones, it can take
  up to 20 minutes. The important thing is to beat at the highest speed of
  your mixer.
   Also if it is a hot and humid day, it will take longer also. STEP 9: Test
  the divinity.  The first and most important test occurs when you lift the
  beaters.  If the candy falls back in ribbons that immediately merge back
  into the batter, it isn't done.
   Eventually, a stationary column will form between the beaters and the
  bowl.  Candy will lose its sheen/gloss and stop being sticky; a teaspoonful
  dropped onto wax paper will hold its shape, even a peak. If you machine is
  laboring and the candy is not quite there yet, you have two choices: Pour
  anyway and put into a frost free freezer to set up....or finish by hand.
  STEP 10:  Fold in the flavorings and nuts and/or other optional items using
  the mixer or if very thick, a wooden spoon. STEP 11: Drop or spread the
  divinity either on wax paper-covered cookie sheets or the buttered pan.
  Dripping it by teaspoon is harder work for you but it ripens quicker and is
  ready to eat sooner. A neat trick is to put the candy into a pastry bag and
  pipe onto the wax paper.  If you spread it in the pan, you will have to
  wait up to 24 hours before it is ready. But you maybe one of those that
  think it is better when it is 24 hours old.  Score and cut into squares.
  Store in an airtight container at room temperature or in a refrigerator.
  Makes 1 pound but looks like more. Recipe CANNOT be doubled; it can be
  frozen but not for extended periods of time.
