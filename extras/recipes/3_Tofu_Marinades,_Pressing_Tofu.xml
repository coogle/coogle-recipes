      <step>  Pressing: Split the block lengthwise.  lay several layers of paper towel on
  a flat surface; place the tofu cut side down on the towels, put another
  couple of layers of paper towel on top, cover with something flat and rigid
  (I use a cutting board) and place a weight on top (I use a gallon jug of
  brandy :-)
  
  I read somewhere that baking the tofu after pressing the water out and
  before marinating helps the tofu to absorb the marinade better.  So, I cut
  up the tofu after pressing, then bake at 375 deg for 15 min.  Then I put
  the tofu in the marinade, wait awhile, then stir fry or grill.  Works great
  for me. From: pasquale@lanl.gov (Gina Pasquale).
  
  let it sit for 45 minutes or longer; this presses out the excess water in
  the tofu, and makes it chewier and less likely to crumble. It can then be
  grilled or baked, or cut up for use in stir-fries. I usually marinate it
  after pressing. Here are a couple of marinades to get you started:
  
  1) 1/2 cup light soy 1/2 cup dry sherry 2 tbs fresh grated ginger 2 cloves
  minced garlic
  
  2) 1/2 cup fresh soy 1/2 cup lime juice 1 TBS ground cumin 1 TBS olive oil
  2 serrano chiles, seeded and diced
  
  3) 1 cup orange juice 3 tbs jamaican jerk sauce
