    <directions>
      <step>  Rinse the basil, shake off any excess water, and pat the basil dry. Bruise
  the basil lightly with a wooden spoon and pack it loosely into a 1-quart
  glass jar with a non-metallic lid. Add the oil and let the mixture stand,
  covered, in a cool dark place for 1 month. Strain the oil into a glass
  pitcher, pour it into glass jars, and seal the jars with their lids. The
  oil keeps in a cool dark place for about 6 months. Makes about 4 cups.
