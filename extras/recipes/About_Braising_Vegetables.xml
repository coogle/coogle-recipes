      <step>  *Braising is similar to stewing but uses less liquid compared to
  water-steaming, it develops greater nuances of flavor and preserves more
  color in vegetables.
  
  *Some recipes for braised vegetables call for a combination of cooking
  methods: Certain ingredients -- usually carrots or other dense-textured
  vegetablesâ€”may be first sauteed in oil or butter to develop color and
  flavor, then cooked slowly in a small amount of liquid: wine, sherry,
  vegetable stock, defatted beef or chicken stock, or a combination of these.
  
  *The steam-filled atmosphere inside a tightly covered pan or casserole
  releases the food's essential oils and juices, enhancing the taste and
  aroma of the vegetables and creating an appetizing glaze.
  
  *Any root vegetable -- carrots, onions, leeks, celeriac -- is a candidate
  for braising; so are celery, cabbage, Belgian endive, fennel and broccoli,
  or a medley of these vegetables. Swiss chard, kale and mustard braise well
  if cooked in a very small amount of liquid until barely wilted.
  
  TIPS **Start the braising process with about 1/4 cup liquid per 2 cups of
  vegetables, adding more only if the food cooks dry before it is tender.
  
  **Any heatproof casserole with a tight-fighting lid can be used for
  braising as long as the dish conducts heat well.
  
  **Braising can be done on top of the stove or in an oven.
  
  **Braising times depend on the variety of vegetables used, their size and
  shape, their maturity and freshness.
