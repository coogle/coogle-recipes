      <step>  Grease 13" by 9" baking pan. In large bowl, mix walnuts, sugar and
  cinnamon, set aside. In baking pan, place 1 sheet of phyllo, allowing it to
  extend up sides of pan; brush with butter or margarine. Repeat to make 5
  more layers; sprinkle with 1 cup walnut mixture. Cut remaining phyllos into
  approximately 13" by 9" rectangles if desired; otherwise, just be sure to
  butter the edges so you can fold them over after you add the filling.
  Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Place one phyllo rectangle in pan; brush with
  butter or margarine. Repeat to make at least 6 layers, overlapping small
  strips of phyllo to make rectangels, if necessary. Sprinkle with 1 cup of
  the walnut mixture. Repeat step 3 three more times. Place remaining phyllo
  on top of last walnut layer. Trim any phyllo that extends over top of pan.
  With sharp knife, cut just halfway through all layers in a diamond pattern
  to make 24 servings. Bake 1 1/4 hours or until top is golden brown.
  Meanwhile, in 1-quart saucepan over medium hear, heat honey until hot, not
  boiling. Spoon hot honey evenly over baklava. Cool in pan on wire rack at
  least 1 hour, then cover and leave at room temperature until serving time.
  To serve: Finish cutting through layers.
