      <step>  Cut asparagus into 1 1/2" to 2" lengths, reserving tips. Melt butter
  over medium heat in non-stick, 9" saute pan. Add asparagus stems, not
  tips, and cook, stirring occasionally, until stems begin to soften,
  about 5 minutes.
  
  In mixing bowl, lightly beat eggs with water and 2 tablespoons cheese.
  Eggs should lighten slightly but should not foam. Add asparagus tips
  and stir well.
  
  Add egg mixture to saute pan. Cook 1 minute, then begin forming
  frittata, pushing sides of egg mixture into center, allowing liquid
  eggs to come in contact with pan. Continue pushing, without stirring,
  until eggs on bottom are solid and just beginning to brown, about 3-4
  minutes. Cover with lid and cook last minute, to set top of eggs.
  
  Place dinner plate directly over saute pan and firmly holding plate
  and pan together, invert, so eggs come out onto plate. Remove pan
  from plate, return pan to heat and slide eggs back into pan so that
  eggs are now upside-down. Cook another 1-2 minutes, depending on how
  runny or firm you want the frittata to be.
  
  Alternatively, place pan (oven-proof only) under broiler and cook just
  long enough to puff top and brown lightly.
  
  Slide frittata out onto clean plate. Dust top with remaining 2
  tablespoons cheese. Season lightly to taste with salt.
