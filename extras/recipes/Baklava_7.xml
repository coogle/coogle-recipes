    <directions>
      <step>  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Coarsely grind (or finely chop) walnuts and
  almonds; place in a mixing bowl. Add cinnamon, allspice, and sugar; mix
  thoroughly. Brush a 9 by 13-inch baking dish with melted butter. Unfold
  filo dough so it lays flat, then cover to prevent it from drying out. Line
  dish with 10 to 12 filo sheets, brushing each with melted butter before
  adding the next sheet. Spread a thin layer of the nut mixture over the
  filo, cover with a filo sheet, brush with butter, and cover with another
  thin layer of the nut mixture. Repeat process until all of the nut mixture
  is used. Then cover with the remaining filo sheets, brushing each with
  butter as you layer it in the dish. Brush top sheet lavishly with butter.
  With a very sharp knife or single-edged razor blade, cut diagonally across
  the pan to make small diamonds, going only deep enough to reach through the
  unfilled top filo layers. Insert a clove up to base of bud in center of
  each triangle. Bake until evenly browned and crispy (about 1[1/2] hours).
  Meanwhile, prepare syrup and set aside to cool. Remove pastry from oven,
  cool slightly, and pour cooled syrup evenly over the top; it should
  penetrate all of the layers. Cool several hours or overnight.
  
  Serving Ideas : Finish cutting through the filo layers to serve.
  
  NOTES : Thawed in refrigerator overnight if frozen. Yield: 3 dozen
  diamonds.
