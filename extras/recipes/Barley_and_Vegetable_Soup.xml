      <step>  In response to the person requesting barley soup recipes: I saw this today
  on the Ask Dr. Weil website at www.drweil.com.
  
  It called for 2 tablespoons olive oil which I substituted with broth or
  wine to saute the veggies in (or a slight nonstick oil spray ). I would
  probably use a pretty flavorful veggie stock since the seasoning in this
  recipe is minimal...
  
  Barley has been cultivated since the Stone Age and has been fermented to
  make beer since not long after that. Like other cereal grains -- wheat,
  millet, oats, corn and rye -- barley is a great source of fiber and
  carbohydrates, and can also be used to make cereal, bread and soup. Folk
  medicine uses barley in barley water, made by simply soaking barley in
  water, which is reputed to be a great tonic during convalescence. "Pearl"
  barley is the name of the grain when it's been polished, after the husk and
  bran have been removed. It's the form most commonly used in soups. Grains
  like barley keep well. Their bulk and comparative cheapness make them a
  useful staple, especially at this soup-worthy time of the year, so be sure
  to keep some in your cupboard.
  
  In a saucepan, combine the barley and 3 cups of vegetable stock. Bring to a
  boil over medium heat, cover, and simmer for 1 hour, or until the liquid is
  absorbed.
  
  Meanwhile, heat the saute liquid in a large pot and add the onion, carrots,
  celery, and mushrooms. Cover and sweat the vegetables for about 5 minutes,
  until they begin to soften.
  
  Add the remaining vegetable stock and simmer 30 minutes, covered.
  
  Add the barley and simmer 5 minutes more. Add salt to taste and ladle into
  bowls. Serve garnished with some chopped fresh parsley.
