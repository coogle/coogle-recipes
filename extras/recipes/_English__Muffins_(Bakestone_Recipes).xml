      <step>  (Note:  Over here, and in England, these are just called "muffins", and are
  the ones in the song about the Muffin Man who lives in Drury Lane. They did
  actually sell them door-to-door every morning in London until the turn of
  the century or thereabouts.) . Sift the flour and salt into a bowl and
  leave in a warm place. Dissolve the yeast and sugar in 1/4 pt of the warm
  milk and water.  Leave to froth, then mix in the fat. Stir all the liquid
  into the warm flour and beat well until smooth and elastic. Cover and prove
  in a warm place for 50 minutes or until doubled in bulk. Turn onto a
  well-floured board and knead, working a little more flour if necessary to
  make the dough easier to shape. Round up the dough, roll into a thick
  sausage shape and (using the sharpest knife you have) slice into 8 to 10
  portions, each about 1 1/2 ~ 1 3/4 inch thick. Shape each one into a round
  with straight sides.  Put onto a greased baking sheet. Cover (I use greased
  plastic wrap) and put in a warm place to prove for 30-40 minutes or until
  springy to the touch. Leave room for expansion and be careful not to
  over-prove, as the muffins will get flabby and lose their shape. Warm and
  grease the bakestone lightly. Lift the muffins carefully onto the bakestone
  and cook over very moderate heat for 8-10 minutes until pale gold
  underneath.  Turn and cook the other side.  Wrap in a cloth and keep warm
  if cooking in batches.  To serve, insert a knife in the side, pull the top
  and bottom slightly apart, and insert slivers of butter. . These are
  strongly recommended.  The taste of them hot off the bakestone, griddle or
  frying pan makes Thomas's look very poor indeed by comparison.
