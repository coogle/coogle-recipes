      <step>  optional, depending on how strict you want to be about the vlf: 6 drops or
  so of toasted sesame oil (doesn't add dramatically to the fat, but
  *greatly* improves the flavor for us "real" hummus fans - makes up
  partially for the lack of tahini)
  
  Combine all ingredients in blender and blend smooth. Garnish with a dash of
  paprika and serve w/pita triangles, in a sandwich, etc. My favorite is
  hummus on a pita with carrots, cucumbers, and lettuce (that was lunch
  today, in fact!)  Hummus is so easy to make that you can whip it up while
  eating breakfast to take to work (like I did today) for all you people
  looking for quick lunch ideas.
