  &gt; &gt; I just got some really interesting information from a friend who is &gt;
  very versed in Judaism :-) &gt; &gt; &gt; Oh, and you are supposed to have meat too,
  but I don't know why. She
  
  I can think of two reasons for the meat.  One is simple - there is a old
  saying in Judaism (from the days when neither was more than weekly fare any
  way) - "There is no simcha [joy] without meat and wine."  Every meal in the
  sukkah should be a celebration (that's why I suggested bread with each
  meal.)
  
  Another (and this is pure speculation) may harken all the way back to
  Temple days, when there would be massive, and ever-increasing, extra daily
  sacrifices during the week of Sukkot.  This is a pilgrimage festival as
  well, so Jerusalem would be filled with people.  It just makes sense that
  the extra meat (once the priests and Levites get their shares) would be
  distributed to the crowds.  I could easily be wrong - anyone know what
  happened to all the Sukkot sacrifices?
