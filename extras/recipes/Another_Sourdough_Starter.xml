      <step>  Make a starter of 1 bottle stale beer with equal parts of flour. Let set as
  usuall until you have a sourdough starter (about 3 days) then mix 1 cup
  starter with 2 cup warm water, 4 T sugar and 2-1/2 cups flour. Beat till
  smooth. Set in gas oven (turn off) and let sit 28 hours. Beat in 3 eggs, 1
  T salt, 1 Cup sour cream, 1/3 cup bacon grease and enough flour to make a
  soft dough. (about 7-8 cups) knead till smooth. Let rise till doubled punch
  down and let rise again. Form into 2 loves. Let rise. Bake 375 about 30
  minutes. IT has taken anywhere from 3 hours to 12 hours to rise so hang in
  there. This was the sourest sourdough I'd ever eaten but it was to die for.
