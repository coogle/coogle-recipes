    <directions>
      <step>  Place ribs in a flat pan or dish. Pour sauce over ribs, turning so as to
  coat both sides; pierce meat with a large fork. Marinate 8 hrs. turning
  once. Remove ribs from marinade and brush off excess sauce to avoid burning
  Broil or cook over coals for 10 mins. Brush with marinade and cook 4-5
  mins. more. Heat remaining sauce and serve with ribs.(Ribs may be cooked in
  a covered pan in a 350 deg. oven for 1 1/2 hours, if desired.)
