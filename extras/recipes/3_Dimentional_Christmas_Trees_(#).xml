      <step>  Make double recipe Basic Holiday Cookie dough. Roll out 1/4 of dough at a
  time on a well-floured surface 3/16th inch thick. Cut out trees for total
  of 16. Bake on pans coated with cooking spray in 350 F. oven for 12
  minutes, until lightly browned at edges. While still warm cut 8 trees in
  half vertically. Cool on rack. Spread one side of cookie trees and half
  trees and edges with icing. Press on candy-coated chocolate candies (M&amp;Ms).
  Let dry. Repeat with other sides. Let dry. Pipe bands of icing down center
  of whole tree on both sides. Push half trees into icing band on both sides.
  Hold until icing firms. Let dry. Dust tops with confectioner's sugar. Makes
