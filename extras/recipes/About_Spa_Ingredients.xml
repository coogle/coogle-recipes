      <step>  EVAPORATED SKIM MILK - Substitute an equal amount of evaporated skim milk
  for whipping cream in rich soups, chowders, cream-based sauces and even
  pumpkin pie filling. --Chef Jackie Abreau, The Spa at Doral, Miami
  
  CHICKEN BROTH - Avoid having to add butter to white rice by cooking it with
  low-sodium chicken broth instead of water. You can also baste chicken
  breasts with broth to prevent them from drying out while cooking. -- Chef
  Michel Stroot, the Golden Door Spa, Escondido, CA. See the Golden Door
  Cookbook at bookstores (1997+)
  
  FRUITY EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL - Its intense flavor makes a little go a long
  way. Fill up a spray bottle (available at beauty supply stores) and spritz
  the oil on saute pans, salad greens, grilled tortillas, oven-baked french
  fries and pasta. --Chef Cary Neff, Miraval, Life in Balance, Catalina, AZ
  
  YOGURT CREAM - Make this lowfat stand-in for whipped cream by beating
  together 1/4 cup fat-free cream cheese, half a cup of nonfat vanilla yogurt
  and a teaspoon of honey or maple syrup. -- Chef John Luzager, Canyon Ranch
  Health Resort, Tucson, AZ
  
  APPLESAUCE - When baking breads and cakes, substitute two tablespoons of
  unsweetened applesauce for each tablespoon of oil needed. -- Chef Janice
  Coon, Green Valley Spa and Tennis Resort, St. George, UT
