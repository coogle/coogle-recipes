      <step>  While sofrito is simmering, cook 2 cups rice.  Set aside.  Also prepare 1
  lb dry or two cans, drained pigeon peas. To prepare dry peas, simply cook
  in boiling salted water until done; drained peas can simply be tossed with
  cooked rice.  Place rice in pot large enough to hold rice, peas, and
  sofrito. (Add them to pot in this order). Toss until thoroughly mixed and
  warmed. It may be necessary to rewarm the rice mixture.
