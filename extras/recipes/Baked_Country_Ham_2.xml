    <directions>
      <step>  Remove ham from wrapping and scrub thoroughly with stiff brush to remove
  excess pepper and any mold. Put ham in large kettle; cover with cold water.
  Let soak overnight. Remove ham; discard water. Place ham in clean kettle;
  cover with cold water. Simmer for approximately 20 min/lb or until tender.
  Cool ham in water. Drain. Remove rind from ham; score fat in large diamonds
  or desired design. Place ham in shallow, open roasting pan. Bake at 350
  degrees, 15-20 min. Coat ham, generously with corn syrup; pat on brown
  sugar. Bake 30 min. Drizzle with more corn syrup and sprinkle with brown
  sugar halfway through baking time if a heavy glaze is desired. Cool
  completely. Chill.
