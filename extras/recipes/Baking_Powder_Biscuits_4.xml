      <step>  Preheat the oven to 450. Grease on 8-inch square baking pan or small baking
  sheet. Put the flour, baking powder and salt into a large mixing bowl. Add
  the vegetable shortening and toss it to coat with the flour. Break the
  chunk into 5 or 6 smaller chunks and start rubbing the flour and shortening
  together with your fingers and letting the mixture fall back into the bowl.
  This does not take long; when the mixture looks like irregular lumps you
  have mixed enough. Add the milk all at once and stir to moisten all the
  flour and shortening. Dust a surface with flour, turn the dough onto the
  surface and knead the dough ten times. Pat the dough into a circle about
  1/2 to 3/4 of an inch thick. Cut the biscuits with a two-inch cookie cutter
  and place on the prepared pan with a little space between the biscuits.
  Bake 15-18 minutes or until the tops are lightly browned. Serve hot with
  butter and honey. Yield: 15 biscuits
