  Add one once of tequila to a tall thin glass such as a parfait glass or
  champagne flute. Carefully add about 1/2 teaspoon (1 teaspoon for the chile
  head version) of tabasco down the side of the glass; it should sink to the
  bottom. Even more carefully add one ounce of Sambuca (an Italian anise
  liquor).  You should have three layers, with the tabasco in the middle.
  Drop a coffee bean into the drink. This is usually drunk in one gulp, then
  you bite the bean.
  
  You can probably substitute ouzo or anisette for the sambuca, and your
  favorite hot sauce for the tabasco as long as it's not too thick.  If the
  densities of the substitutes are much different, however, you might not get
  nice distinct layers.
