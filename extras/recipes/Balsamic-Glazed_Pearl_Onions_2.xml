      <step>  In a saucepan of boiling water blanch one third of onions 3 minutes and
  drain. Blanch remaining onions in batches in same manner. Cool onions and
  peel.
  
  In a large heavy skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but
  not smoking and saute onions until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add
  vinegar and water and simmer, stirring occasionally, until onions are
  tender, about 15 minutes. Transfer onions with a slotted spoon to a
  platter, reserving liquid. Glazed onions may be prepared up to this point 2
  days ahead and onions and reserved liquid chilled separately, covered.
  Reheat onions in reserved liquid, adding a little water if necessary, and
  transfer with slotted spoon to platter. Simmer reserved liquid until
  thickened and syrupy and reduced to about 1/2 cup.
  
  Spoon sauce over onions and serve warm or at room temperature.
  
  Yield: 8 servings
