      <step>  SERVES 6-8
  
    James Brown, of Engine Company 81 in the Bronx, New York, won the contest
  with this dish. You can tell just by reading the recipe that this fireman
  knows his stuff. I can imagine the pleasure that Company 81 gets when this
  man turns on the fires . . . on his stove.
  
    He calls this dish "All Hands" because the line refers to that difficult
  situation in a fire when absolutely everyone is needed. I can tell you that
  all hands will show up when you cook this chicken dish.
  
    Officer Brown gives help to everyday cooks as when he points out that
  this dish "has the advantage of holding in heat in case of an alarm or they
  can sit for a while and be reheated." (At about six each evening, doesn't
  your house sound as if there is about to be a four-alarm fire?)
  
    You will enjoy this and it is not really difficult to make. I am not
  giving you his proportions, as they might seem a bit large for a family of
  four. So, cut down. I have already cut it in half!
  
    Using a heavy water glass or wooden mallet, pound each breast between 2
  sheets of plastic until about double in area size but not torn.
  
    Heat a large frying pan and add the olive oil and garlic. Stir for a
  moment and add the spinach. Saut‚ the spinach until barely wilted. Add salt
  and pepper to taste. Cool and drain in a colander.
  
    Lay each chicken portion flat on the counter and salt and pepper to
  taste. Place 1/12 of spinach in a layer on each piece of chicken and add a
  bit of the cheese. Roll up and hold together with toothpicks.
  
    Mix the milk with the eggs and dip each piece into the egg wash and then
  dredge in the bread crumbs. Pan-fry in a bit of peanut oil until golden
  brown, turning once. Or deep-fry in oil at 375ø until golden brown. I
  really prefer these pan-fried. Remove the pieces to a pan and cover. Bake
  in a 350ø oven for
       30    minutes.
  
    In the meantime, prepare the gravy. Drain the fat from the frying pan,
  leaving the scrapings in the pan. Heat the pan and add the butter and
  mushrooms. Saut‚ until tender and then stir in the flour, being careful to
  keep stirring as it thickens. We don't need lumps! Add the chicken stock,
  wine, and lemon juice. Cook until thickened, stirring with a wire whip.
  Check for seasoning of salt and pepper.
  
    Pour the gravy over the chicken rolls and serve with a parsley garnish.
  
    For a winner menu, serve this with Frittorta and Corn Oysters (see
  recipes).
