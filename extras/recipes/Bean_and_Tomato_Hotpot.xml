  From: LRLady@aol.com (Ruth Hoffman, Lake Zurich, IL, LRLady@aol.com)
  I bought a vegan cookbook at a used-book store not long ago, and we've been
  enjoying some yummy recipes from it.  It's a British book, called The Vegan
  Gourmet by Heather Lamont.  Not fatfree, but usually low fat and mostly
  easy to modify. Here's my version of a delicious dish I adapted from this
  book recently. Aussies will recognize a familiar ingredient--Vegemite, also
  known as yeast extract. For those who don't know what it is, it's
  *definitely* an acquired taste, and not one I would go to any trouble to
  acquire.  But our son brought back a jar of the stuff from Australia, and I
  figured, what the heck, we only go around once. (Original called for 1
  Tbsp; could probably be eliminated, but I suspect it added to the richness
  and complexity of the flavor without being identifiable.)
  
  Saute onions in broth for 5 minutes.  Add carrots, celery, leek, and garlic
  and saute for 5 more minutes.  Add kidney beans, tomatoes with their juice,
  stock, yeast extract, and salt and pepper.  Mix well.
  
  Place in casserole dish.  Arrange potatoes over the top and sprinkle with
  salt and pepper.  Spray lightly with cooking spray and cover casserole.
  Place in oven (350 deg F, 180 deg C, Mk 4) for 2 hours. Remove lid for last
       30    minutes to brown potatoes.
  
  Serves 4 hungry people, or maybe 6 with a generous side dish.  (I tend to
  get lazy and do one-dish meals.)   Or 2, if you want to save the leftovers
  for tomorrow night.
  
  This was scrumptious!  I might try adding a layer of portabella mushrooms
  in the middle, next time. (Maybe my son will think they are meat...:-)).
  But it didn't really need any help of any kind. The leftovers are good,
  too!
