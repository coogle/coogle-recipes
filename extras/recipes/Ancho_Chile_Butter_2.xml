  Recipe By: the California Culinary Academy
  
  Note: New Mexico, pasilla, or California chiles can be substituted for
  ancho chiles.
  
  1. Put chiles in a bowl and cover with boiling water. When they are
  rehydrated,  drain them and put them in a food processor or blender;
  process until finely chopped.
  
  2. In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, melt butter. With machine
  running,  add hot butter to chiles in a fine stream. Blend until color is
  homogeneous and  mixture is smooth.
  
  3. Let stand at room temperature until butter reaches a spoonable
  consistency. Use immediately, or refrigerate or freeze for later use. Makes
      1/2    cup.
  
  Microwave Version: Complete step 1. Put butter in a glass dish and
  microwave on 100% power until butter is melted, about 45 to 60 seconds.
  Continue with steps 2 and 3.
  
  Seasoned butters make an excellent topping  for any roasted, broiled, or
  barbecued meat, poultry, or fish. The butters can  be made up to four days
  ahead and refrigerated up to week; they can also be  frozen two to three
  months.
