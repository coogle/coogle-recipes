      <step>  Melt the chocolate in a double boiler over medium-low heat. It's a good
  idea
  to stand over the chocolate while it's melting and stir until it has melted
  completely; take it off the heat immediately.
  
  Whip the cream and set aside.
  
  Pour the brandy and hot water slowly into a bowl with the egg yolks,
  whisking briskly as you go until completely mixed. Whisk in the melted
  chocolate. Keep whisking even after the mixture is completely combined;
  this
  will help cool the chocolate.
  
  Whip the egg whites and the sugar, adding the vanilla as you beat, until
  peaking but not dry. Fold the egg-white meringue into the chocolate mixture
  carefully with a wooden spoon. Fold in the whipped cream. This is the most
  critical part of the recipe.  The key to a great chocolate mousse is
  incorporating cooled chocolate into whipped cream. The chocolate must be
  cool
  to the touch or the cream will separate. Lightly blend the two mixtures
  until
  uniform.
  
  The mousse is actually at its best texture as soon as mixed.
