      <step>  1. This is very simple -- I invented it years ago and have served it to
  others who like it.  Just quarter and dry the hearts, saute in a pan with
  quartered mushrooms, butter/margarine and some garlic. Makes a nice side
  dish with chicken and rice/potatoes.
  
  BTW -- when using artichoke hearts I always drain them AND dry them
  (squeeze dry in a clean dish towel) thoroughly, otherwise they taste
  watery.
  
  2. Buy some good fresh pasta and alfredo sauce at the grocery.  Cook as
  directed and combine sauce with artichoke hearts, cooked shrimp, and
  mushrooms (I usually saute the mushrooms first).  You could use cooked ham
  or chicken in place of the shrimp.
  
  3. Saute artichoke hearts with some other stuff and mix with cooked rice.
  The other stuff can include green onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, garlic,
  tomatoes.  This would be the stuff I would use -- you can make up your own
  list.  I usually just look at what's in the fridge... Sauteing can be done
  in butter/margarine or oil or both combined. 4. Eat cold, dipped in a
  little mayonnaise.
  
  5. Put in pasta salad.
