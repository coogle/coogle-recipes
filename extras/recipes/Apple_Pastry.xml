  1 serving: Each provides 238 cal, 8 grams fat, 30% CFF
  
  In a small mixing bowl combine flour and salt; cut in margerine until
  mixture resembles coarse meal. Add yogurt and mix thoroughly. Form dough
  into a ball; wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (may
  be kept in the refrigerator for up to 3 days).
  
  Between 2 sheets of wax paper roll dough, forming a 4 and 1/2 inch circle
  about 1/8 inch thick. Carefully remove wax paper and place dough on foil or
  small cookie sheet. Preheat oven to 350 degrees./
  
  Core, pare, and thinly slice apple; arrange on pastry and sprinkle with
  nutmeg and cinnamon. Bake until crisp and golden, 20-30 mins.
  
  During last few minutes that pastry is baking, heat apricot spread; as soon
  as pastry is done, brush with warm spread. Posted to Digest
