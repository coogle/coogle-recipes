    <directions>
      <step>  Preparation time:  1/2 day, but constant attention is not required.
  
  Simmer the sauce, stirring until the sugar is melted.  Then, stir
  occasionally for a few minutes while the oil is drawn out of the
  lemon. Do not allow to scorch.  Remove from heat and set aside.
  
  Broil the ribs flesh side up until browned.  Turn and cook flesh side
  down, brown again.  Now brush both sides with some of the sauce and
  cook on each side for five minutes.  Do not let them burn or blacken!
  The RIBS at this point look good, but they are still raw.
  
  Cut the ribs apart and dip each rib in the sauce.  Pile the ribs high
  on a full-sized oven broiler rack and pan, and pour any remaining
  sauce, less a cup or so, over the ribs.
  
  Cover the ribs with heavy-duty aluminium foil, tucking in around the
  outside edge of the pan to make an airtight container. Cook in the
  oven at 325F for 2 hours.
  
  Remove from oven and open very carefully.  Beware the live steam that
  will rush out.  Allow to sit, opened for a few minutes.
  
  The end result is smoked, steamed, tender meat which falls from the
  bones. All fat is rendered and drains into the pan.
  
  Use leftover sauce when warming over the second day.
  
  SAUCE VARIATION: Molasses, tomato paste, onion, spices
  
  Unfortunately I don't have anyplace to grill outdoors so can first
  part of the recipe (which calls for outdoor grilling) be substituted
  by putting the ribs in the oven?
  
  Rinse and dry ribs; then cut apart.  Heat about 3 cups oil in a wok.
  When very hot, add ribs in small batches and fry until brown and
  crispy, about 5 minutes.  Remove and drain.
  
  [They are absolutely delicious at this point.  Once I forgot to make
  the sauce until I was half done eating the ribs!  They're great
  served at this point with various Chinese dips ++mustard with a dish
  of chopped scallions, hoisin sauce, chili sauces, etc.  S.C.]
  
  Combine sugar, vinegar, salt and soy sauce.  Remove oil from wok;
  return wok to stove and turn heat to high.  When hot, add vinegar
  mixture. Cook, stirring, over high heat until syrupy.  Add ribs; toss
  in the mixture until well coated.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

  I have never tried that, but I suspect a compromise could be worked.
  Most of the actual cooking occurs during the oven portion.  The
  purpose of the outdoor grilling is to both sear and seal the meat,
  and impart the unique flavor of barbecue to the ribs by exposing it
  to the smoke created when the drippings from the meat vaporize on the
  hot briquets.  An additional (and desirable) flavor is also imparted
  to the meat if real charcoal briquets are used.
  
  The addition of the "Secret Sauce" during the last portion of the
  outdoor phase also contributes to the taste.
  
  As a non-outside alternative, I would suggest oven broiling of the
  ribs as a substitute for the outdoor searing.  During the final
  portion, the coating of the slabs could still be done (the 5 minutes
  per side part).
  
  To possibly aid in giving a barbecue-like flavor, a drop or two of
  liquid smoke could be added **only** to the small portion of the
  sauce that is used to coat the ribs during the searing process.
  There's a possibility the time under the broiler may need to be
  shortened when compared with the outside method.
  
  Liquid smoke is a very potent ingredient, and I have never found it
  satisfactory for my own use.  Obviously, some must, as it is still
  sold. As a rule of thumb, I would advise forgetting about the amount
  recommended for use on the bottle, and if in doubt, "use less". Then,
  following the oven broiling, you can continue by cutting the ribs
  apart, and continuing by the recipe.
