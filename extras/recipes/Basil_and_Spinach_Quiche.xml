  1.  Slice the onions into very thin rounds.  Put 3-4 tbsp extra virgin
  olive oil in a heavy skillet and bring to medium high heat. Saute the onion
  rings until just starting to turn golden. Remove from skillet and set
  aside.
  
  2.  Remove the seeds and ribs from the peppers and slice into julienne
  strips. Break the florets of cawliflower into bite size pieces. Thinly
  slice the mushrooms and make matchstick slices of the zucchini. Place all
  the sliced veggies into the skillet and saute until just starting to turn
  limp--about 4 minutes or so. Remove from the skillet and drain well.
  
  3.  Mix together the eggs, flour, milk, salt and pepper and whip with a
  wisk until very frothy.
  
  4. Use a deep quiche dish or a 10" deep dish pie plate.  Spray well with an
  olive oil cooking spray.  Wash the basil and spinach and pat dry with a
  paper towel. Line the cooking dish with the basil and spinach so that the
  points of the leaves overlap the edge of the dish by about 1/2". Spray
  lightly again so that the leaves stay together. Gently pour about the 1/4
  of the egg mixture over the leaves.
  
  Place about 1/4 of the veggies into the cooking dish, making sure they are
  spread around.  Sprinkle a handful of the parmesan cheese over all.  Repeat
  the eggs, veggies and cheese until the dish is filled and you have ended
  with cheese. Bake at 350 degrees until done--about 25-30 minutes. The eggs
  will really puff up, the tips of the spinach and basil will turn a little
  brown and the cheese forms a nice crusty top on the quiche.
  
  During the summer when our vegetable garden is at its peak, I substitute
  other veggies such as eggplant and hot peppers and green beans and leeks
  for the onions.
