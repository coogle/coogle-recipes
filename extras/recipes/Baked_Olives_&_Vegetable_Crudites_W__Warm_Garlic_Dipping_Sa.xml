      <step>  reheat the oven to 375 degrees. In a baking dish, arrange the olives in a
  single layer. Add the wine and 2 tablespoons of the oil. Cover tightly with
  foil. Bake until the olives are fragrant, approximately 45 minutes. Most,
  but not all, of the liquid should be absorbed; the olives should be tender
  and somewhat plump.
  
  Meanwhile, using a mortar and pestle, combine the garlic, parsley, mixed
  herbs, chile flakes, and the remaining olive oil. Mash to form a paste.
  (This may also be done in a food processor, although the texture will not
  be the same.) When the olives are out of the oven and still hot, combine
  with the garlic paste, tossing thoroughly to mix. Add black pepper to
  taste. Let the olives marinate for several hours or overnight before
  serving. The olives may be stored, refrigerated, for several weeks. Bring
  the olives to room temperature before serving.
  
  CRUDITES:
  
  6 cups mixed crisp peeled vegetables, such as carrots, celery, scallions,
  parsnips, jicama, and red bell pepper, cut into thick strips.
  
  WARM GARLIC DIPPING SAUCE:
  
  4 tablespoons unsalted butter 10 garlic cloves, finely slivered 10 anchovy
  fillets, well rinsed and chopped 1 cup olive oil 2 tablespoons sherry
  vinegar 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
  
  In a saucepan, melt the butter. Add the garlic and saute until soft but not
  brown. Stir in the anchovies, olive oil, vinegar, and parsley and heat
  through. Keep warm.
  
  Serve the olives and crudites arranged on a platter or on individual plates
  around a ramekin filled with the warm dipping sauce. Serve immediately with
  lots of crusty French bread.
