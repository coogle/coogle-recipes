      <step>  1. THE GARLIC AND CHILES. Set a heavy ungreased skillet or griddle over
  medium heat. Lay the unpeeled garlic on the hot surface and let it roast to
  a sweet mellowness, turning occasionally, until soft when pressed between
  your fingers (you'll notice it has blackened in a few small spots), about
  15 minutes. Cool, then slip off the papery skins and roughly chop.
  
  While the garlic is roasting, break the stems off the chiles, tear the
  chiles open and remove the seeds. Next, toast the chiles a few at a time on
  our medium-hot skillet or griddle; Open them flat, lay them on the hot
  surface skin-side up, press flat for a few seconds with a metal spatula (if
  the temperature is right you'll hear a faint crackle), then flip them. (If
  pressed long enough, thy'll have changed to a mottled tan underneath. If
  you see a slight wisp of smoke, that's okay, but any more will mean burnt
  chiles.) Now, press down again to toast the other side. Transfer to a bowl,
  cover with hot water and let rehydrate for 30 minutes, stirring regularly
  to ensure even soaking. Pour off all the water and discard.
  
  2. THE SEASONING. If using whole spices, pulverize the oregano, pepper,
  cumin and cloves in a spice grinder or mortar then transfer to a food
  processor or blender, along with the drained chiles and garlic. Measure in
  the broth and process to a smooth puree, scraping and stirring every few
  seconds. (If you're using a blender and the mixture won't move through the
  blades, add more broth, a little at a time, unitl everything is moving, but
  still as thick as possible.) With a rubber spatula, work the puree through
  a medium-mesh strainer into a bowl; discard the skins and seeds that remain
  behind in the strainer. Tast (it'll ahve a rough, raw edge to it), then
  season with salt.
  
  ADVANCE PREPARATION - Covered and refrigerated, the marinade will keep for
  about 2 weeks; it also freezes well
  
  OTHER CHILES YOU CAN USE - Though I want you to learn the unique flavor of
  ancho by making this seasoning solo, it's very commonly made with half
  ancho (for rich sweetness) and half guajillo (for tangy brightness); a few
  chipoltes in the mix adds heat and complexity. Always substitue an
  equivalent weight of chiles.
  
  TRADITIONAL DISHES THAT USE THIS ESSENTIAL AS A STARTING POINT - Spice
  Chile-Baked Oysters, Street-Style Red Chile Enchiladas, Simple Red Mole
  Enchiladas, Chile-Glazed Sweet Potatoes, Red Chile Rice, Red Chile-Braised
  Chicken, Ancho-Marinated Whole Roast Fish.
  
  Suggested Wine: T
  
  NOTES : If you take a few minutes to make this medium-spicy seasoning paste
  from toasted, rehydrated ancho chiles, ssweet roasted garlic and spices,
  you'll have a gold mine in the refrigerator.  More versatile than salsas
  (which are spooned on as condiments), this deep burgundy, almost fluffy
  puree can be turned into the most complex dishes in the Mexican collection,
  from slow-simmered, rich, red mole and quick-seard red-chile enchiladas to
  garnet-colored rice.  I even use it to flavor American style baked beans .
  Start withthis seasoning to learn how to clean, toast, soak, puree and
  strain dried chiles - it'll seem awkward if you haven't done it before, but
  when you taste what the seasoning does to different dishes, you'll keep
  making it until the process seems second nature
