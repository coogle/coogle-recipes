      <step>  BAKING POWDER BISCUITS: In a medium mixing bowl stir together flour, baking
  powder, and salt. Using a pastry blender, cut in shortening till mixture
  resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in the center. Add milk all at once.
  Using a fork, stir just till moistened. Turn dough out onto a lightly
  floured surface. Quickly knead dough by gently folding and pressing dough
  10 to 12 strokes or till nearly smooth. Pat or lightly roll dough to
  1/2-inch thickness. Cut dough with a 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter Hint: (if
  you don't have a biscuit cutter, a glass works well to cut biscuits). Place
  biscuits 1 inch apart on a ungreased baking sheet. Bake in a 450 oven for
  10 to 12 minutes or till golden. Remove from baking sheet; serve warm.
  Makes 10 biscuits.
  
  DROP BISCUITS: To make drop biscuits: Prepare as above, except increase
  milk to 1 cup. Do not knead or roll or cut dough. Using a big spoon drop
  dough into 12 mounds on a greased baking sheet. Bake as directed above.
  Makes 12 biscuits.
  
  BUTTERMILK BISCUITS: Prepare as above, except stir 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
  into dry mixture and substitute buttermilk or sour milk for the milk Bake
  as directed above. Makes 10 to 12 biscuits.
