    <directions>
      <step>  Mix the following in a NON METAL BOWL WITH NON METAL UTENSILS!!!!!!!
  Mix the yeast and the first 1/2 c water together and let stand until
  "yeasty". Then sift the dry stuff together, and combine it with the
  yeast/water and the other 2 c of luke warm water. Mix well with a
  non-metal spoon and let stand uncovered at room temp for 3-5 days,
  covering only at night, and stirring 2-3 times a day.
  
  Remove 1 cup and start the ten day ritual, as below. With the
  remaining mix, add 1/2 c water, 1/2 c flour, and 1 t sugar. Let stand
  at room temp one day (until very bubbly). Store covered in fridge for
  up to 10 days for in recipes or as further starter.
  
  10-day ritual (all done at room temp in non-metal bowl)
  
  Day 1--you receive "Herman" and do nothing Day 2--stir w/non metal
  (pref. wooden) spoon Day 3--stir Day 4--stir Day 5--add 1 c each of
  flour, sugar, and milk. Stir Day 6--stir Day 7--stir Day 8--stir Day
  9--stir Day 10--"Herman is born!" Add 1 c each of flour, sugar, and
  milk. Stir well. Pour 1 C each into 3 containers. Give to
  friends/enemies with above
  
  instructions. Reserve one cup for reprocessing for yourself.
  
  The friend who gave me this starter recipe controls her batch by only
  adding 1/3 c of each ingredient on days 5 and 10. You can do this to
  prevent yourself from becoming overrun! The bread recipe below is a
  good solution to the starter, but you end up 50 lbs overweight and
  have a freezer full of loaves unless you learn to control the
  "Herman" or pass it on to friends.

  To Remaining Batch of "Herman" (after you remove the 3 cups and
  restart or pass them on) add the following.
  
  Remaining Herman 2/3 c oil 3 eggs 1 c nut/fruit of choice (applesauce,
  bananas, etc) 2 c flour 1 1/2 t baking powder 1 c sugar 3/4 salt 1/2
  t soda 1 t cinnamon
  
  Mix well and bake at 350 45-50 min. Makes 2 loaves.
