      <step>  Mix cream cheese and butter with a fork; add pesto and mix well.      Line
  a small (3-cup) loaf pan or bowl with plastic wrap, leaving several inches
  of overhang on each side.  Make a thin layer of provolone slices on   the
  bottom and partially up the sides.  Spread 1/3 of the pesto mixture   over
  the cheese; artistically arrange 2 or 3 sun-dried tomatoes, 4-6 bell pepper
  strips, and about 1 tablespoon toasted pine nuts over the pesto. Repeat
  layers until all ingredients are used (reserving some of the pine nuts to
  sprinkle on top), pressing down well between layers.  Chill overnight or
  for several days.  Serve at room temperature on a platter wreathed with
  fresh basil sprigs.  Additional toasted pine nuts, sun-dried tomatoes cut
  into flowers, red bell pepper strips, and fresh basil sprigs may be used as
  garnish.      NOTE: Torta may be presented inverted or not. Keeps several
  weeks   refrigerated.  Although best served at room temperature, it slices
  best   chilled.  I like to serve it on a platter adorned with grape leaves
  and   small clusters of red and white grapes. VARIATIONS: = =
  =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D Use lemon pesto; substitute slivered toasted
  almonds for the pine nuts; omit the sun-dried tomatoes and add 1 teaspoon
  lemon zest to the cream cheese mixture.      Use purple pesto; omit the red
  pepper if desired and increase the sun-dried   tomatoes.      Use cinnamon
  basil pesto; omit the sun-dried tomatoes and the red peppers   if desired,
  and use pecans instead of pine nuts.      Source: The Herb Garden Cookbook,
