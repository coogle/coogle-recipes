      <step>  Blueberries freeze very well. Simply sort the fruit, don't wash, and pack
  in freezer bags or boxes. When you use the frozen fruit, simply wash in
  running water and use. Don't thaw. This is especially nice when adding
  blueberries to fruit salad or muffins where you don't want the rest of the
  product to turn purple. If you've already washed the berries, let them dry
  before freezing. My favorite way to eat blueberries is "straight up." For
  breakfast try the berries in rice (brown, white, what ever) with a little
  cinnamon and/or clove.
