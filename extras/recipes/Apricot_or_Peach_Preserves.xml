      <step>  Use firm, slightly underripe fruit. Peel and cut into lengthwise slices:
  apricots or peaches. The fruit may be dipped briefly into boiling water to
  facilitate the removal of skins. Remove the stones. Measure the fruit.
  Allow to each cup: 3/4C sugar, 2tbsp water, 1-1/2tsp lemon juice. Stir this
  syrup and cook it 5min. Add the fruit. You may omit the water and just pour
  the sugar over the apricots/peaches, letting them stand 2 hours before
  continuing. Simmer fruit til transparent. Place in glasses or jars. If the
  syrup seems too abundant, place the fruit in jars and reduce the syrup til
  thick. Pour over fruit. Add to the syrup(if desired): lemon juice -- about
  2tsp to every cup of fruit.
