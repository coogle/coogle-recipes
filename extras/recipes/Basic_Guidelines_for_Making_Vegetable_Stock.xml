      <step>  First choose the ingredients to reflect the soup in which the broth is
  being used.  A general guideline for making vegetable broth is to use about
  8 to 12 cups of vegetables cut into pieces no bigger than 1 inch. Put these
  with 2 quarts of cold water in a large nonreactive pot with no more than
  six different herbs. Bring to a boil over high heat, then lower the heat
  and simmer for 30 to 45 minutes. Strain and use as is or concentarte the
  flavor by simmering to the desired strength (by taste).
  
  When using dried herbs, lessen quantities by one-half to two-thirds but
  always add *to taste*
  
  vegetable:      carrots, celery, potatoes, winter squash, summer squash,

  NOTES : Stock is very personal. It's quickly prepared.  Or make ahead and=
       freeze in a size that's convenient for you. -- Maggie
       Cabbage family vegetables were left off the list of ingredients
       because=
       they give a strong (dominant) flavor; the flavor grows stronger
       (ages in=
       the freezer).  If you like, use mild cabbages: napa, bok choy, a
       little=
       savoy, young brussels. Or use chard and endive. When using
       cabbage, try to=
       use the broth right away. Also, straining is important.  Use a
       very fine=
       sieve.  -- Maggie and patH
