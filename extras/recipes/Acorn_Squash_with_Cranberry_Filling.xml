  Prick squash several times with fork to allow steam to escape. Place in
  oven and microwave at High (100%) until soft when tested with fork, 10 to
  12 minutes. (If oven doesn't have carousel, rotate and turn squash after
  half the cooking time. Let stand.
  
  Place cut side up in 10" square casserole.
  
  Combine cranberry sauce, honey and allspice in small bowl. Microwave at
  High (100%) until hot and bubbly, 3 to 4 minutes, stirring after half
  cooking time. Spoon into squash halves. Microwave at High (100%) 2 to 3
  minutes until heated through.
