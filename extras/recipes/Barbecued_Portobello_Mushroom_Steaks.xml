    <directions>
      <step>  1. Prepare grill.
  
  2. Wipe mushroom caps with paper towel; brush each cap with 1 tablespoon
  LHJ's Barbecue Sauce and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
  
  3. Arrange mushrooms, cap side down, on grill; tent with foil. Grill 3 to 5
  minutes over medium-low coals. Remove foil; brush each mushroom with 1
  tablespoon sauce. Turn mushrooms and brush with another 1 tablespoon sauce.
  Grill 3 to 5 minutes more, until tender when pierced with a fork. Serve
  with remaining barbecue sauce, heated, if desired. Makes 4 servings.

  NOTES : Mushroom steaks? You bet! The luscious, meaty texture of
  portobellos are a perfect vegetarian choice for the grill, and their rich,
  woodsy flavor can stand up to the heartiest of barbecue sauces. Portobellos
  are available whole or as packaged caps.
