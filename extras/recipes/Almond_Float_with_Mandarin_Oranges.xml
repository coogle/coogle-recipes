    <directions>
      <step>  A light, sweet, gelatinous pudding of very delicate
  texture, totally unlike a typical gelatin dessert -
  Jello it is not. Have large cooled bowl or
  (preferably) 9" x 9" glass dish ready for gelatin
  mixture. Add agar-agar to boiling water and stir until
  thoroughly dissolved. (Watch for burning on bottom.)
  At this stage, agar-agar will impart noticeable odor,
  but it does not carry through to finished dish. Add
  evaporated milk and sugar; bring back to boil and boil
  for 1 minute, stirring constantly.  Add almond
  extract.  Slowly add hot water, continuing to stir
  until sugar is completely dissolved.  As soon as
  mixture returns to boil, turn off heat. Pour mixture
  into bowl for setting.  When it has cooled slightly,
  cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.  Turn
  jellied mixture out onto flat plate, then cut it in 1"
  squares.  Place squares in individ- ual serving bowls
  with Mandarin orange wedges and their juice.  Cover
  and return to refrigerator until ready to serve.
