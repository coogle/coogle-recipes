    <directions>
      <step>  Wipe apricots with a damp cloth.  Do not soak or wash them, as this would
  make them too moist.  Mince or chop them very finely. Add a few tablespoons
  confectioners' sugar to taste, and knead thoroughly by hand, wetting your
  hands from time to time to make a smooth, soft, slightly moist paste. Shape
  into marble-sized balls. Roll them in confectioners' sugar and let them dry
  overnight.  You can insert half a bright green pistachio nut on top to
  offset the rich orange of the apricots.
  
  A splendid variation is stuffed apricotina.  Use 1 tb. ground almonds or
  finely chopped pistachios mixed with 1 heaping tsp. sugar. Make a small
  hole in the center of each apricotina. Put in a little of the filling,
  close the hole again, and roll in confectioners' sugar.
