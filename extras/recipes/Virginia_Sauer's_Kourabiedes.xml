      <step>  This was originally posted by Virginia Sauer and is wonderful.
  
  ~- Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
  
  ~- In large mixing bowl, cream butter until it is fluffy and white. (This
  will usually take about 15 minutes if using an electric mixter, or 45 with
  a wooden spoon.)
  
  ~- Gradually add 1/3 cup powdered sugar. Continue beating until mixture is
  soft and fluffy.
  
  ~- Add egg yolk and cognac. Continue beating until thoroughly blended.
  
  ~- Gradually add flour, stirring with wooden spoon to yield soft, buttery
  dough.
  
  ~- Knead gently with your hands until smooth (5 - 8 minutes).
  
  ~- Roll dough between palms of hands walnut-sized balls.
  
  ~- Arrange close together on ungreased cookie sheets.
  
  ~- Place pan on center shelf of oven.
  
  ~- Bake until golden (12 - 15 minutes).
  
  ~- Gently transfer to wire rack with spatula.
  
  ~- Sprinkle with powdered sugar.
  
  ~- When cool, roll cookies in powdered sugar until evenly coated.
  
  NB: These are very fragile.
  
  Yield: 42 walnut-sized cookies
