      <step>  Jerusalem artichoke, also known as sunchoke, is a
  seasonal vegetable that looks a bit like fresh ginger,
  and tastes like a cross between potatoes and
  artichokes.  We enjoy it very much in Israel. To
  prepare jerusalem artichokes as a side dish, peel and
  cook in boiling lightly-salted water for 1/2 to 1
  hour, covered, until soft. Add salt and pepper to
  taste, and sprinkle with lemon juice.
