  Phillip Graebing wrote that he had lost his blueberry recipes. I have a
  cookbook called "The Blueberry Connection" - 209 pages of nothing but
  blueberry recipes. Being it's that time of the year, hopefully some of the
  following will refresh Phillip's files
  
  Serve about 1/3 blueberry blend with 1/3 white wine and 1/3 crushed ice.
  Top with sprig of mint.
  
  "It is said that the Indians used the blueberry as an anti-spasmodic to
  ease the pain of childbirth. This remedy was later adopted by many of the
  early settlers."
