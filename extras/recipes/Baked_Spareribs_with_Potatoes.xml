      <step>  2     llb pork spareribs; up to 2-1/2
        2    baking potatoes; cut into
  :          -long wedges
  
  ~--------------------------MARINADE FOR SPARERIBS--------------------------
        2    cloves minced garlic
      2/3 c  hoisin sauce
        1 tb nom yee; (red bean curd)
  :          -optional
      1/4 c  brown sugar; packed
      1/2 c  tomato catsup
        2 tb rice wine; or dry sherry
      1/4 c  honey
        1 tb soy sauce
  
  Remove excess fat from bottom part of spareribs. Place slab of spareribs on
  a cutting board and cut between bones about 1/2" so marinade soaks through
  well. Place all marinade ingredients in a large bowl and mix together until
  well-blended. Place ribs in a shallow pan and spread marinade on both
  sides, and set for at least two hours (overnight is best.)
  
  Pour enough water in the baking pan to 1" from bottom, but make sure it
  does not touch the rack. Place spareribs on rack, meaty side up, and bake
  at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. Turn spareribs with leftover marinade, add
  potatoes to the side of the pan, and bake for another 30 minutes. Turn
  spareribs once again and switch to broil for the last 4-5 minutes (keep an
  eye on the ribs) until spareribs have a nice glaze, almost burnt
  appearance. Remove, cool for 10-15 minutes to ease cutting up into
  individual ribs. Serve with potatoes on the side.
