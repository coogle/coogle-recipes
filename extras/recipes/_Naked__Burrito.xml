  I just wanted to thank everyone for their inspired burrito suggestions.  I
  will try them all!  Until then, I have come up with a surprisingly
  delicious no-brainer - the naked burrito. Yes, it's a burrito without a
  tortilla.
  
  1. Dump cooked brown rice in a bowl.
  
  2. Top with beans of choice (heated pinto, black, or ff refried, canned
  OK).
  
  3. Spoon on a dollop or two of salsa (this is the ingredient that will make
  or break the dish, so go for something really good).
  
  4. Top with shredded vegies and condiments of choice (shredded lettuce,
  tomatoes, and onions are a must, but after that, there are no rules.
  Steamed assorted vegies, ff cheese and/or yogurt, etc)
  
  Enjoy!  This meal is fast, delicious, colorful, and will satisfy most
  burrito cravings.  btw, I made an amazing discovery I'm sure I've mentioned
  before, but it's worth saying again: Safeway's "Southwest Salsa" (bottled)
  is the best prepared salsa I've ever tried. I am a real snob about jarred
  salsa, usually preferring to make my own. But I love this stuff! If you
  haven't tried it, do. It's good. The Medium level of hotness is just
  perfect in my opinion.
