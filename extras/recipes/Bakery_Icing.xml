  I do cake decorating and the recipe I use is as follows (it usually does
  have that thin crust that Patty was looking for):
  
  Cream the shortening and flavorings together.  Then add the sugar, a little
  at a time, until the mixture begins to look like coarse crumbs.  Then add
  salt water a little at a time until the mixture begins to get smooth and
  becomes the consistency of icing.
  
  Cake decorators generally like their icing on the stiff side, but it is a
  matter of personal taste.  Add the salt water until it is the consistency
  you want.
  
  After you ice the cake, and it sits for a couple of hours, it should have
  that "micro-thin" crust your looking for.
  
  As a personal side note, I usually add more liquid vanilla flavoring and
  butter flavoring to my icing, because I want the taste, not the terrible
  sweetness of some icings.  Almond extract can also be used in place of the
  vanilla, if you want to try something a little different.  If you do use
  almond, I'd use less than the vanilla, because it tends to be a stronger
  flavoring.
  
  Note: Van-o-van is a powdered vanilla flavoring that is used (as far as I
  know) only by cake decorators.  Every cake decorating store that I have
  been in has it in stock. I'm not really sure of the significance of it on
  the whole, perhaps Wilton could answer that. I do know that if you add more
  than what the recipe calls for, it makes your icing bitter. I have run out
  of it before and can certainly tell the difference.
