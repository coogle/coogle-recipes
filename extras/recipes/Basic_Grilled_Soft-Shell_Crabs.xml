    <directions>
      <step>  Crabs should be liberally and often basted with sauce while grilling over
  low heat about 12 inches from coals. Grill about 4 to 5 minutes per side.
  
  Barbecue Sauce: Add oil to a favorite barbecue sauce ( 1 part sauce to 2
  parts oil)
  
  White Wine Marinade: Combine 1/2 cup vegetable oil, 1 teaspoon chopped
  fresh basil, and 1 teaspoon lemon pepper. Slowly add 3/4 cup dry white wine
  and beat with a whisk to combine. Let stand at room temperature 30 minutes,
  or up to several hours in the refrigerator, for the flavors to blend.
  
  Seafood Baste: Mix together 1/2 cup melted butter, 3 tablespoons lemon
  juice, 2 tablespoons minced parsley, and 1/2 tablespoon grated lemon rind.
