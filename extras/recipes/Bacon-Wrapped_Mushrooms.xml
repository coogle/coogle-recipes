      <step>  1. Cut the mushrooms in half. If it is a very small mushroom, leave it
  whole. If it is an oversized mushroom, cut into thirds or fourths.
  
  2. Slice bacon in half (width-wise) at an angle. To do this, hold the knife
  perpendicular to the bacon, then turn the knife slightly so that the knife
  is now at an angle, then slice the bacon.
  
  3. Take a slice of bacon and wrap it around a mushroom half, overlap the
  ends, and poke a toothpick about half-way into the mushroom at the overlap.
  
  4. Repeat this for each bacon slice and mushroom half.
  
  5. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
  
  6. Arrange mushrooms on a drip pan about 1/2-inch apart. Bake for 20
  minutes. Serve hot.
  
  NOTES: Depending on how thick the bacon is, you may need more than 1 pound.
  Also, don't let soak mushrooms in water or they'll absorb too much water
  and then they'll shrink and crack.
