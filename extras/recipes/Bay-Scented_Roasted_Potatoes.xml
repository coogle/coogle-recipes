    <directions>
      <step>  1. Starting at one end of potato and moving to the other end, make a
  crosswise slit every half inch.
  
  2. Cut bay leaves lengthwise into thirds. Stick a piece of bay leaf into
  
  each slit. Place potatoes in an oiled baking dish.
  
  3. Bring stock or broth to a boil and pour over potatoes. Drizzle with
  olive oil, then sprinkle with salt. Bake at 350 degrees until potatoes are
  tender and brown and cooking liquid has evaporated, about 40 minutes.
  Serve, removing bay leaves prior to eating.
