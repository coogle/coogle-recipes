      <step>  Here is a recipe, developed young man here in the Detroit area. With this
  recipe, he won a $10,000 scholarship to Johnson and Wales College, which is
  considered a top-notch cooking school, located in Charleston, SC. This
  young man, Andre Black, spent 2 weeks developing this recip, this cake was
  among the top 19 recipes chosen &lt;out of 270&gt; as winners. Andre was on the
  front page of the Detroit News yesterday, along with the recipe. The
  Detroit News food writer, Robin Mather says "For a Carrot Cake, this is a
  hell of a fruit cake. She found this cake suited to 3 8" layers.
  
  Preheat oven to 350.  Grease and flour three 8" layer pans. Combine eggs,
  sugar and oil.  Beat on high speed until creamy and thick, 3-5 minutes.
  Sift together flour, cinnamon, salt and baking soda. Slowly add 1/3 of the
  dry ingredients to egg mixture; beat well. Repeat with remaining dry
  ingredients, beating well after each addition. Batter will be extrememly
  stiff; it may be necessary to blend with a spatula or spoon. One by one,
  fold in carrots, coconut, pineapple, walnuts and raisins.
  
  Divide batter between the 3 prepared cake pans.  Bake at 350 for 40-45
  minutes, arranging cake pans in oven once. The cake is done when the tester
  inserted in center comes out clean. Let cake cool in pans 5 minutes. Turn
  out onto rack to cool completely.
  
  When cakes are cool, prepare frosting: combine margarine, cream cheese,
  sugar and vanilla.  Beat until smooth. Frost cake.
  
  * Andre's original recipe, written in professional baking terms, calls for
  6 oz beaten eggs, 15 1/2 oz of sugar, and 12 oz cake flour
  
  Andre hopes tobbecome an executive chef, and own his own resturant someday.
