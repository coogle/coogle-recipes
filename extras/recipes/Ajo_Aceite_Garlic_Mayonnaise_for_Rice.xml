  *RAW EGG WARNING
  
  The American Egg Board states: "There have been warnings against consuming
  raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may be contaminated
  with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of food
  poisoning....Healthy people need to remember that there is a very small
  risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods accordingly. Use only
  properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled, fresh, grade AA or A eggs.
  Avoid mixing yolks and whites with the shell."
