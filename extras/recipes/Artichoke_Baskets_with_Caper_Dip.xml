      <step>  Impress your favorite valentine with these lovely artichoke baskets filled
  with a creamy fat free dip. FOR ARTICHOKES: With sharp knife, cut off
  stems. With scissors, snip off prickly tips. Rinse and shake ff water. Wrap
  artichokes in plastic wrap and place on microwave safe plate or place in a
  microwave safe casserole. Add 1/4 cup water and cover. Place in microwave
  and cook on high 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 minutes until lower leaves can be pulled
  off and base pierces easily with fork
  
  rotate and rearrange halfway through cooking.  Let stand 3-5 minutes.
  
  TO PREPARE DIP: In small bowl combine mayonnaise, garlic, capers and caper
  brine.
  
  TO PREPARE BASKET:  Remove 1/4 of one side of artichoke leaves; reserve
  leaves
  
   Carefully remove and discard the choke.  Place on small plate. Fill inside
  of basket with caper kip and allow some to spill out onto the plate. Chill
  until ready to serve. If desired serve with reserved artichoke leaves.
  NOTE* If desired, artichokes can be cooked on stove top. Place trimmed
  artichokes stem side down in small saucepot just big enough to hold them
  snugly.  Pour boiling water to a depth of 1 inch,cover and steam 45 minutes
  over medium heat until done as above. With tongs, remove from pot; drain.
