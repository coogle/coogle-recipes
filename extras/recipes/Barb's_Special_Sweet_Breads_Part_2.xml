      <step>  Place the dough on a lightly floured board and cut it in half. Roll each
  piece into 24" X 6" strip.  Spread the surface with Almond butter. Fold the
  edges lengthwise toward the center, allowing 1" space in the center.
  Sprinkle the plumped currants and spoon the Vanilla Cream into the 1" space
  between the edges. Repeat with second strip. Place both lengths of dough on
  a baking sheet and shape strips together like a giant pretzel, tucking in
  the ends.  Brush with the egg wash and sprinkle with almonds. Allow the
  dough to rise 1 hour in a cool room. When light, bake 35 minutes in a 375
  degree F. oven. (or, if making small pastries, 10-12 minutes) Cool and ice.
  Cut in 3" pieces. This makes 1 large pastry or 24 small ones. See later
  parts for necessary fillings and icings.
