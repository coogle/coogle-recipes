      <step>  If you're using fresh artichokes, fill a large bowl with cold water and
  squeeze the juice of 1/2 lemon into it. Reserve both lemon halves. Peel
  away any hard green leaves from each artichoke and slice off the top of
  each stem. Cut away the yellow leaves as close to the base as possible,
  then skin the base and the stem, removing the tough, green outside layer.
  Remove the fuzzy "choke" (center part) with the tip of a knife and discard
  it. Cut each artichoke in half and rub the squeezed lemon half over all
  surfaces, then drop the artichokes into the bowl of water. When all the
  artichokes are trimmed, drain and rinse them; then place them in a pan with
  enough water to cover. Simmer, covered, over medium heat until tender,
  about 12 minutes. Drain and set aside. If you're using canned artichoke
  hearts, drain and set aside. Cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling
  salted water until al dente. Meanwhile, dice the artichokes and combine
  with the diced mozzarella. Add salt.
  
  Peel the rind from the uncut lemon, being careful to keep it in one or two
  large pieces; set aside. Juice this lemon and the remaining 1/2 lemon; set
  aside the juice. When the artichoke mixture and pasta are ready, pour the
  milk into a small pot and add the lemon rind. Heat until the milk begins to
  bubble; then remove the lemon rind and remove the pot from the heat. In a
  separate pan, melt the butter or margarine over low heat and whisk in the
  flour, 1 teaspoon at a time, stirring constantly. When all the flour has
  been added, continue to cook and stir constantly for 2 minutes. Remove from
  the heat and slowly add hot milk, stirring constantly. Add the reserved
  lemon juice. Over low heat, cook and stir until the sauce thickens
  slightly, about 2 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400F. Spread a little sauce
  on the bottom of a 9 x 13" baking pan. If you're using fresh pasta, roll
  each rectangle around a portion of the artichoke mixture and place the
  cannelloni in the baking pan; if you'r using uncooked cannelloni, prepare
  the pasta according to the package directions; drain and let cool. Stuff
  each piece with the artichoke mixture and place in the pan. Spread the
  remaining sauce over the top. Cover the pan with foil and bake 15 minutes.
