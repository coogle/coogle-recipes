  This won't require your ice cream maker, but this sorbet was simple and
  tasty -- and my nearly two-year-old liked it a lot. A great dessert with no
  sugar added.
  
  Cut the bananas into quarter-inch slices, coat with the lemon juice, place
  on a cookie sheet, and freeze.
  
  After the bananas are frozen, puree them with the remaining ingredients in
  the appliance of your choice (my cuisinart had to work pretty hard, but it
  was very entertaining for the son to watch strawberries become sorbet.)
  
  Serve immediately in chilled cups. Leftovers don't freeze well, but they
  make a nice flavoring for homemade yogurt.
