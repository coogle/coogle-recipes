      <step>  Mix well. Form into rather large pellets (the size of a raisin). Offer to
  birds every half hour, feeding as much as they will take each time. Mixture
  may be refrigerated. Offer water from medicine dropper, but very little is
  needed and should be given carefully to avoid aspiration into lungs causing
  pneumonia. It is next to impossible to overfeed.
  
  Note: It is illegal in most states to cage most wild baby birds, but this
  food may save them until they can be released.
