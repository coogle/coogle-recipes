      <step>  Fill a small bowl with very hot tap water. Place olive oil in small saute'
  pan and set over medium-high heat. When oil barely begins to smoke, add
  chiles and roast, turning until skins are soft and slightly puffed. Remove
  chiles to the hot water and let soak for 30 minutes.
  
  In the same skillet and again over high heat, roast garlic cloves, shaking
  the pan until skins are golden brown and shriveling. Remove from heat. When
  cloves are cool to the touch, squeeze garlic out of the skins and reserve.
  
  When chiles have finished soaking, drain, seed, and stem them. Place them
  and the garlic in the bowl of a food processor equipped with a steel blade.
  Add coriander, salt, chili powder, lemon zest, and one-fourth of the
  butter. Process until all ingredients are well-pureed. Gradually add the
  rest of the butter and process until it is incorporated. Add parsley and
  process a second more just to fold in.
  
  Remove to a storage container and refrigerate to store. To use, melt the
  butter over low heat.
  
  MAKES 2 1/2 CUPS NOTES: The great thing about composed butters is that they
  keep so well and have so many uses. Let this butter, for example, hang
  around your refrigerator for a couple of months. Toss pasta with it. Make
  your next omelet with it. Saute' boneless chicken in it. Dollop some on a
  piece of grilled fish. Cook shrimp in it. Spread it on slices of an old
  baguette, run them under the broiler, and serve as an appetizer that will
  bring guests back for more. See what we mean? And do not forget to melt
  some of the butter over a baked potato. This particular butter uses the
  mild dried ancho chile pepper to give it a South-west flavor and a rich,
  rusty color. Allow 2 tablespoons of butter for every 1/4 pound of pasta - a
  little more if you are adding other ingredients, such as vegetables or
  chicken, to the pasta.
  
  PREPARE-AHEAD/SERVING NOTES: The butter will keep refrigerated for at least
  three months. ESSENTIAL GEAR: Electric food processor
  
  HERE IS A GOOD USE FOR ANCHO CHILI BUTTER:
  
  Blanch asparagus spears (we especially like California purple asparagus for
  its plump, tender stalks that require no peeling). Allow 4 to 6 meaty
  spears per serving. Drain and rinse with cold water. Set aside. In a large
  saute' pan, melt Ancho Chile Butter, allow 3 to 4 tablespoons per serving.
  Add asparagus spears and quickly warm in the hot butter. With tongs, remove
  asparagus to hot plates. Leave any extra butter in the saute' pan. While
  asparagus warms, cook fresh egg fettuccine until tender. Drain and
  immediately toss with the remaining butter in saute' pan. Serve the pasta
  over the asparagus spears and top with a light grating of Parmigiano
  Reggiano .
