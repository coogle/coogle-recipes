      <step>  Preheat oven to 400 degrees and butter a large round area (about 6 inches)
  in middle of a baking sheet. In a small bowl whisk egg white just until
  foamy. Add flour, sugar, almonds, and a pinch salt and beat until smooth.
  Put 2 teaspoons batter on buttered area of baking sheet and with back of
  measuring spoon spread batter evenly into a round about 3 inches in
  diameter.
  
  Bake cookie in middle of oven until golden around edge but pale in center,
  about 5 minutes. Working quickly, with a spatula remove cookie from baking
  sheet and invert onto a work surface. Put a fortune in middle of cookie and
  fold cookie in half. Bend pointed edges of cookie toward each other and
  hook them onto rim of a liquid measuring cup or deep heavy bowl to cool
  completely.
  
  Make more cookies with remaining batter in same manner, letting baking
  sheet cool between cookies. Cookies may be made 3 days ahead and kept in an
  airtight container.
  
  Yield: 8 cookies
  
  *Note: To make the fortunes, cut 3 by 1/2-inch strips of paper and write or
  type your own fortunes with non-toxic ink. Because you must work quickly to
  shape the cookies, it's best to make them one at a time. Using more than
  one baking sheet is also helpful because you won't have to waste time
  waiting for the baking sheet to cool. A liquid measuring cup or deep heavy
  bowl is a good tool for shaping the cookies.
