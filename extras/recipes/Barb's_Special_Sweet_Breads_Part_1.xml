      <step>   For the dough:
    Put the water in a mixing bowl and sprinkle the yeast over it. Stir until
  the yeast has dissolved. Beat the egg into the yeast mixture, and set
  aside.
    Sift together the flour, sugar, and salt.  Add the yeast mixture. Knead
  until the mix forms a ball- if too moist add a bit more flour. Knead 10
  minutes more.
    Roll out to an 11" square. Spread 1/2 cup butter over the surface of the
  dough.  Fold the dough into thirds and wrap in a damp cloth. Refrigerate 20
  minutes. Repeat this process beginning from rolling out the dough, two more
  times.
    While the dough is in the refrigerator the last time, you should prepare
  the fillings, icings or other recipes you will need for the finished
  pastries.
    The following parts will give you the variety of pastries made with this
  dough, and the methods.  They will be followed by additional recipes needed
  to prepare the pastries.
