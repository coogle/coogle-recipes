  Let cream cheese, butter and egg yolks stand at room temperature at least 2
  hours.  Beat cheese in a mixing bowl with a wooden spoon or blend at low
  speed in electric mixer. Add butter and continue beating. When well
  blended, add sugar, then egg yolks, one at a time. Add vanilla and fold in
  almonds.
  
  Wash and dry the inside of a Pashka mold or a new 2 quart clay or plastic
  flowerpot with drain holes in the bottom.  Line the pot with a double
  thickness of cheesecloth wrung out in cold water.  Spoon cheese mixture
  into the pot to the brim. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate several
  hours or overnight on a plate.
  
  To unmold, trim around and discard top of the cheesecloth.  Invert a
  dessert plate over the opening of the flowerpot and quickly turn the whole
  thing upside down. Place on table and gently lift off pot, tugging at the
  cheesecloth lining if necessary.   When the pot is clear, gently remove the
  cheesecloth.
  
  Garnish the base and top of the Pashka with whole strawberries and
  strawberry halves.  Serve with additional crushed, sweetened strawberries
  as a sauce. You may add some brandy or liqueur to the sauce if you wish.
