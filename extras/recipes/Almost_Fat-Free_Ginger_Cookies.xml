      <step>  Preheat oven to 350F.  Into a medium bowl, sift together flour, ginger,
  baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, and salt.
  
  In a large bowl with electric mixer, beat Prune Butter and sugar until
  well-blended.  Beat in egg and molasses until well-blended. Stir in flour
  mixture until completely mixed.
  
  Place a little sugar in a medium bowl.  Scoop out heaping teaspoonfuls of
  mixture.  Using your palms, roll into 3/4-inch balls and drop into the
  sugar.  Roll to cover the surface completely; then place balls 2 inches
  apart on ungreased baking sheets.
  
  Bake until cookies are slightly rounded and tops appear lightly browned and
  crackles.  Remove baking sheets to wire racks to cool slightly. The, using
  a metal pancake turner or palette knife, remove cookies to wire racks to
  cool completely.  Repeat with remaining cookie dough and sugar. Store in
  airtight containers.
  
  * Prune butter is from "Secrets of Fat Free Baking" by Sandra Woodruff. To
  make one cup, combine 8 oz prunes and 6 tb water or fruit juice in food
  processor.  (I used apple juice for the batch for this recipe.)

  Cookie Book" by Elizabeth Wolf Cohen
  
  Notes:  The cookies have 39.5 calores (3.6% from fat) and 0.2g fat each.
  They also have more dietary fiber, potassiumn and calcium than the
  originals, and less cholesterol.  They were delicious, but rolling them
  into balls was a nightmare.  They stuck to everything. They may need more
  flour.  They also didn't flaten out as much as the originals. They kept
  their ball shape, for the most part.
  
  The Chef's Comments: "Yesterday i took a cookie recipe that I wanted to
  try, and I made exactly according to the recipe (it was great!) and then I
  made another batch, using the Prune Butter technique. For cookies, the book
  suggests replacing all of the fat with Prune Butter, and removing as much
  sugar as 1/2 to 2/3 the amount of Prune Butter used, to keep sweetness
  consistent witht he original recipe.  The low-fat recipe was a difficult
  texture to work with, and they didn't spread out nicely when cooking. They
  remained little clumps.  But they did taste very good. I have a hard time
  telling the difference between the two, believe it or not. Who would have
  thought substituting prunes for crisco was a wise choice??" - Lisa
