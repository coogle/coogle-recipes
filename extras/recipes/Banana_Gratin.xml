  1. Put rack in center of oven; heat oven to 400-degrees. Grease 6, 12-ounc
  capacity souffle or small baking dishes. (You may substitute large custard
  cups.) Set on baking sheet.
  
  2. Divide bananas between souffle dishes, overlapping them evenly and
  attractively. Lightly brush tops with melted butter. (Can be prepared up to
  2 hours ahead to this point and kept at room temperature.) Before cooking,
  evenly press confectioners' sugar through fine wire mesh strainer to cover
  surface, using about 1 tablespoon per serving.
  
  3. Bake until bananas are very warm, about 8 minutes. Turn oven to broil
  and move cookie sheet to within 8 inches of heat source. Broil until
  surface lightly browns, about 2 minutes more.
  
  4. Serve with a small scoop of ice cream or frozen yogurt or a dollop of
  whipped cream. Serve immediately.
