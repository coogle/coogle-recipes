    <directions>
      <step>  1. Shell and devein shrimp, leaving tail segments intact.
  
  2. Prepare any of the batters (see recipes for "... Batter for Deep-Fried
  Shrimp": "Egg", "Eggless", "Egg-White" or "Separated Egg"). Then holding
  each shrimp by the tail, dip in batter to coat.
  
  3. Meanwhile heat oil. Add shrimp one by one (if dropped in all at once,
  they'll form a solid mass), or place in a wire basket and lower into oil.
  
  4. Reduce heat to medium and deep-fry until shrimp float and are golden on
  both sides. (Depending on size, this will take 3 to 5 minutes.) Drain on
  paper toweling.
  
  5. Serve hot, garnished with lettuce strips and Chinese parsley, and
  accompa- nied by plum sauce, hot mustard, catsup or "Basic Pepper-Salt
  Mix", or "Dip for Deep-Fried Shrimp #1/#2", or "Miscellaneous Dips for
  Deep-Fried Shrimp". Or serve with a sweet-and-pungent sauce (see recipes
  for "Sweet-and-Pungent" Sauces).
  
  NOTE: See Note under "Deep-fried Shrimp without Batter". VARIATIONS:
  
  1. In step 1, strip off legs and devein, but leave the shells intact; or
  else butterfly the shrimp. See "Information: Other Seafood".)
  
  2. After step 1, marinate the shrimp in a mixture of 2 tablespoons soy
  sauce, 3 tablespoons sherry, 1 teaspoon ginger root, minced; and 1/4
  teaspoon salt. Let stand 10 to 15 minutes, turning occasionally. Drain,
  discarding marinade. Then coat with batter as in step 2, or dredge lightly
  in flour.
  
  3. In the above variation, add to the marinade any or all of the following:
  1 scallion, minced; 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder; a few drops of sesame oil.
