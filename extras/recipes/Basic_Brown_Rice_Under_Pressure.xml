    <directions>
      <step>  1. Pick over, rinse, and drain the rice. Heat the oil in the pressure
  cooker. Saute the rice until lightly browned, stirring frequently, about
  1-2 minutes. [This avoids foaming and reduces the possibility of rice
  sticking to the bottom of the cooker.]
  
  2. Turn off the heat and stir in the boiling water (watch for oil
  sputtering), flavouring options, and salt if using.
  
  3. Lock the lid in place and over high heat bring to high pressure. Adjust
  heat to maintain high pressure and cook for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat
  and let the pressure drop naturally while the rice steams in the residual
  heat for 10 minutes. Reduce any remaining pressure with a quick-release
  method. Remove the lid, tilting it away from you to allow any excess steam
  to escape.
  
  4. If the rice is not sufficiently cooked, stir in a few tablespoons of
  boiling water if the mixture seems dry, and replace the lid. Simmer over
  very low heat for another minute or two, or until done. Fluff with a fork
  and serve immediately.
