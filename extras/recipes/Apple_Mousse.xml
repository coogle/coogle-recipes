      <step>  And ... I don't have this book but it is apparently one of the bibles on
  the macro subject: THE SELF-HEALING COOKBOOK, by Kristina Turner, 1987
  Earthtones Press.
  
  Serves 4 to 6: Bring juice and agar to a boil and simmer until agar
  dissolves. Pour into a shallow glass dish and refrigerate until sent.
  Blend/whip with tahini and spoon into individual parfait glasses. Garnish
  with dusting of cinnamon.
  
  SOURCE: DIET FOR ALL SEASONS, by Elson M. Haas (Paperback - ISBN 0890877327
  ~ Celestial Arts - 1995). He does not mention that this particular recipe
  comes from the Turner book but the Turner book is in the "recommended
  reading" list.
