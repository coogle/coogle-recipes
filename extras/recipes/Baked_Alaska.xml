      <step>  Julia (julia@technonet.com) was kind enough to send the recipes I requested
  from Richard Simmons cookbook.... I thought I would share them with the
  list, in case there was anyone else who might like them.
  
  Ahead of time:
  
  1. Preheat oven to 350. Line 2 15x10x1" jelly-roll-pans with parchment
  paper or foli and put aside. Prepare cake mix according to package
  directions and pour batter into each prepared pan, spreading evenly.
  
  2. Bake one pan at a time on middle oven rack for 12-14 minutes, until top
  of cake is srusty and dry. Loosen edges with spatula and immediately invert
  cakes onto wire racks. Cool. Freeze one cake for other desserts, such as
  sundaes with frozen yogurt and fresh fruit.
  
  3. Using biscuit cutter or kitchen shears, cut out 6 circles, about 3 1/2"
  in diameter, from the one cake. Remove scraps.
  
  4. In deep, narrow-based bowl, bring egg whites to room temp. Using
  electric mixer, beat whites with cream of tartar until soft peaks form.
  Continue beating while adding sugar, 1 tbs at a time. Beat until stiff
  peaks form. Beat in vanilla. Set meringue aside.
  
  Just before serving:
  
  5. Preheat oven to 500. Assemble Alaskas: Center frozen scoop of ice cream
  on each angel-food cake base. There should be a 1/2" of cake border around
  base of ice cream.
  
  6. Spoon meringue over each portion of ice cream, dividing evenly. Working
  quickly, use spatula to completely enclose ice cream with meringue. Be
  careful to seal all edges. Meringue should be about 1/2" thick to meet with
  edge of cake. Swirl peaks on top. Use wide spatula and carefully lift and
  place Alaskas a few inches apart on baking sheet.
  
  7. Bake 3 minutes or until meringue is lightly browned. Garnish with
  strawberries, if desired. Serve immediately.
