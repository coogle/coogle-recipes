  Don't be fooled by the simplicity of this recipe!
  
  Mix together (with bare hands is fun).  If it's too runny add some crushed
  biscuits.  Roll into a snake and dust lightly in either castor sugar or
  more coconut. Chop into 1cm thick pieces. Eat the rest of the condensed
  milk (straight out of the tin) while the apricot delight is chilled in the
  fridge.
