      <step>  ROASTED RICE POWDER (THINH) Roasted rice powder is used as a
  flavoring and binding agent in various recipes throughout this book.
  It is necessary to soak the rice first in order to obtain a deep
  golden color after roasting. Soaking also makes the rice easier to
  grind. 1/2 cup raw glutinous rice Soak the glutinous rice in warm
  water for 1 hour.  Drain. Place the rice in a small skillet over
  moderate heat.  Toast the rice, stirring constantly with chopsticks
  or a wooden spoon, until deep golden brown, about 15 minutes.
  Transfer the roasted rice to a spice grinder or blender and process
  to a fine powder (the powder should resemble saw dust). Sift the
  ground rice through a very fine sieve into a bowl. Discard the grainy
  bits. Store the rice powder in a tightly covered jar in your
  refrigerator and use as needed.  It will keep for up to 3 months.
  Yield: 1 cup. SCALLION OIL (HANH LA PHI): Many Vietnamese dishes
  require this delicate scallionflavored oil. Brushed over noodles,
  barbecued meats, vegetables or breads, it complements each item. 1/4
  cup peanut oil, 2 scallions, finely sliced Heat the oil in a small
  saucepan until hot but not smoking, about 300F.  Remove the pan from
  the heat and add the sliced scallions.  Let the mixture steep at room
  temperature until completely cooled. This oil mixture will keep
  stored in a tightly covered jar at room temperature for 1 week.
  Yield: 1/4 cup CRISP FRIED SHALLOTS (HANH KHO PHI): This is an
  important ingredient in his many dishes throughout this book. Use as
  specified in recipes. 1/2 cup vegetable oil, 1/2 cup thinly sliced
  shallots Heat the oil in a small saucepan until hot but not smoking,
  about 300F. Add the shallots and fry over moderate heat until crispy
  and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Do not overcook.  Immediately
  remove the shallots with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
  Reserve the oil for another use. Cooked this way, shallots can be
  stored in a tightly covered jar on the kitchen shelf for up to 1
  month.  Yield: about 1/3 cup. ROASTED PEANUTS (DAU PHONG RANG): Use
  shelled and skinned unsalted peanuts for this purpose.  Cook a small
  amount at a time and use shortly after they are roasted to preserve
  their flavor. Amounts are specified in recipes using roasted peanuts.
  Place the peanuts in a skillet over moderate heat and cook, stirring
  constantly, until the nuts turn golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Allow
  to cool. Pound in a mortar with a pestle or process in a spice
  grinder until the peanuts are a bit chunky. Store-bought
  dry-roasted-roasted unsalted peanuts may be substituted in recipes
  calling for roasted peanuts. PEANUT SAUCE (NUOC LEO): This delicious
  sauce originated in the central region and is used as a dip for many
  dishes in this book.  Usually, tuong, a fermented soybean sauce, and
  glutinous rice are used to produce this sauce. After several
  experiments, I ended up with this variation where tuong and glutinous
  rice are replaced by hoisin sauce and peanut butter, ingredients that
  are more readily available. 1/4 cup roasted peanuts, ground, 1
  tablespoon peanut oil, 2 garlic cloves, minced, 1 teaspoon chili
  paste (tuong ot tuoi), 2 tablespoons tomato paste, 1/2 cup chicken
  broth or water, 1/2 teaspoon sugar, 1 tablespoon peanut butter, 1/4
  cup hoisin sauce, 1 fresh red chile pepper, seeded and thinly sliced
  Prepare the roasted peanuts. Set aside. Heat the oil in a small
  saucepan.  When the oil is hot, add the garlic, chili paste and
  tomato paste, Fry until the garlic is golden brown, about 30 seconds.
  Add the broth, sugar, peanut butter and hoisin sauce and whisk to
  dissolve the peanut butter.  Bring to a boil, Reduce the heat and
  simmer for 3 minutes. Divide the sauce among individual dipping bowls
  and garnish with the ground peanuts and sliced chile. Serve warm or
  at room temperature. Yield: About 1 cup. VEGETABLE PLATTER (DIA RAU
  SONG): Vietnamese meals include an abundance of fresh lettuce, herbs,
  unripe fruits and raw vegetables.  These are arranged attractively on
  a platter and are used for wrapping cooked foods at the table,
  usually dipped in Nuoc Cham and eaten out of hand. The following
  herbs, both very important to the Vietnamese, would be authentic
  additions to the Vegetable Platter: One is the "saw leaf herb"
  (Eryngium foetidum, or ngo gai in Vietnamese), a coriander relative.
  The other is polygonum (P. pulchrum or rau ram in Vietnamese), with
  pinkish stems, pointed green leaves and purplish markings.  They can
  be found occasionally at Southeast Asian markets. If you have access
  to unripe mango, banana, papaya or apple and star fruit (carambola),
  add them to the platter. You may select or substitute the ingredients
  according to availability and personal taste. 1 large head of Boston
  or other soft lettuce, separated into individual leaves, 1 bunch of
  scallions, cut into 2 inch lengths, 1 cup coriander leaves, 1 cup
  mint leaves, 1 cup fresh Asian or regular basil leaves, 1 cucumber,
  peeled in alternating strips, halved lengthwise and sliced thinly
  crosswise, 4 ounces fresh bean sprouts On a large platter,
  decoratively arrange all of the ingredients in separate groups. Use
  in recipes where required. Yield: 4 to 6 servings
