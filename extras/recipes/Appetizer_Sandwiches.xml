    <directions>
      <step>  carefully remove asparagas spears from tin, spread on towel to drain for at
  least two hours ;(if some are very "fat" split in half.  remove crusts from
  bread carefully spread each square with butter, and then spread carefully
  and generously with mayonaise. take a spear and put diagonal on bread -
  sprinkle generously with S &amp; P roll from corner to make a tube. I then cut
  the tube in half to make smaller portions - your choice pile in bowl or on
  plate, cover with aluminum foil (putting in Tupperware doesn't seem to have
  the same effect, who knows why) Refrigerate for several hours. Remove from
  frig at least 1/2 hour before serving.
  
  So - easy right - make it in the morning - and the 1/2 hour out of frig is
  while you're driving to the party ... every party I took these two they
  were the first thing gone, men, kids, everyone said, these are weird, humm
  but good!
