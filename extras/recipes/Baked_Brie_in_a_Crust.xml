    <directions>
      <step>  1. Heat oven according to direction on the back of the crescent rolls
  
  2. Dived dough into two rectangles rather than four triangles lay side by
  side and press edges together so you have a square
  
  3. Lay Brie on top of square and gather up edges so that you completely
  encase the cheese
  
  4. Turn over so the gathered part is on the bottom and place on a baking
  sheet
  
  5. Bake according to direction on the rolls
  
  6. If you are using the nuts; while the brie is baking, toast the nuts in
  butter either in a fry pan or in the microwave
  
  7. Remove Brie from the oven and let set about 5 minutes 8. Place brie on
  serving tray and top with toasted nuts, surround with slices of firm fruit
  such a as apples and pears.
  
  Variations: A. For a sweeter taste spread 2 T Apricot jam over the brie
  before you wrap it up Place brie jam side.
   B. filo dough, or puff pastry can be used instead of the crescent rolls
  
  Ellen's favorite and ALWAYS at any of our family get-to-gethers.
