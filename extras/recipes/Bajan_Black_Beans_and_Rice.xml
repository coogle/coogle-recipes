      <step>  I've posted the Bajan Beans and Rice recipe that I adapted from a recipe of
  Gabe Mirkin's before. This is one of my most favorite recipes and when I
  was making it today I found out halfway through that I didn't have any
  canned white beans. I forgot that I had bought some dried white beans
  intending to cook them up myself. No problem I had two cans of black beans
  and so decided to try the recipe with them. I liked it just as much and it
  made the dish even more colorful. The canned black beans I had weren't
  quite as mushy as the white beans I have used before -- the final product
  was less soupy. For those who may have missed the recipe, here it is again,
  this time with black beans:
  
  Heat 3 cups of water and mix in bouillon. Set aside. Note: any broth may be
  used, I just happen to like Better Than Bouillon especially. Saute garlic,
  onion, and red, green, and habanero peppers in 1/2 cup of broth in large
  pot for 10 minutes. Add remaining broth, tomatoes, and rice and simmer
  covered for 15 minutes. Add zucchini and simmer for an additional 30
  minutes. Stir occasionally to keep from sticking. Add black beans, corn,
  and cilantro and cook an additional 5 minutes to heat through.
  
  Freezes well.
