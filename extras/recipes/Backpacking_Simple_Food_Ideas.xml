      <step>  Here are very, very simple ideas for dehydrated and light-weight foods.
  
  1) Any packaged dinner mix from the grocery and packed in ziploc baggies
  
  ie, Macaroni &amp; Cheese, Rice-a-Roni, Broccoli and Cheese, etc There are tons
  of these things available today. If they call for milk, then the boys can
  carry powdered milk in baggies. Margarine will travel well, and since they
  will be working hard, the extra fat might be desireable.
  
  2) Instant oatmeal and instant grits and bagels are great for breakfast.
  Again, powdered milk can be used with these. Get some of the new Fantastic
  Foods hot cereal mixes--they are warm and filling.
  
  3) Dehydrated vegetables and full meals can be found in camping stores. Add
  dried peas to a box of mac &amp; cheese, for instance
  
  4) Try Ramen noodle soups, or any of those "soup in a cup"s (that can be
  packaged in baggies so they take up less room).
  
  5) Dehydrated bean flakes that mix up almost instantly with water are
  available in HFS. Mix these with some cooked minute rice and put in a
  tortilla. Yum! Flavor them with onion, garlic, cumin powders.
  
  6) Cheese backpacks well. Again, the fat may not be so bad if they are
  hiking all day. And if it's cold, then the fat is almost necessary to help
  them stay warm. (You need a lot more calories when it's cold.) Add a hunk
  to any soup, pasta, rice, or dehydrated veggies you're cooking.
  
  7) Pasta, pasta, pasta. Top it with sauces made from the dry package mixes.
  A lot of these are tasty. High in sodium and preservatives sometimes, but
  for a couple of meals they won't hurt you.
  
  8) Instant mashed potatoes that can be mixed with the powdered milk or
  water only. Make up an instant gravy to go top. (I *really* like the Hain's
  brown gravy mix and it's fatfree and all natural.)
  
  9) Dried fruit can be cooked in some water and put on top of a piece of
  angel food cake for dessert. (Hey, the cake might get crushed a little, but
  it is lightweight!) Add some cinnamon and Tang (in lieu of orange juice)
  and you approximate a Cooking Light recipe.
  
  10) The dry veggie burger mixes would make a great meal. Most of them make
  up with water only and many are quite tasty.
  
  11) Bulgar and couscous cook up in only a few minutes with boiling water.
  
  12) There are lots of dried meats and fish available, but I've never used
  them
  
  As you can see, when we camp, I like to cook things that require water
  only. No fancy cooking and then tough clean up for me! I find that when I'm
  "on the trail", ALL foods taste wonderful because I'm always so hungry. I
  eat things when hiking that I'd never, ever eat at home. I bought hash
  potatoes and green pepper breakfast package from Sam's freezer and fried in
  black skillet for first morning quick and smells and taste good.
