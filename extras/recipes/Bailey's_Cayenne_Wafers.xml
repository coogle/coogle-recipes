      <step>  Lee's Intro: Different versions of these little biscuits are served all
  over the South, using different kinds of cheese, with and without pepper.
  These wafers can be kept for several weeks in a tightly closed tin.
  
  Preheat oven to 350F degrees.
  
  Cream the cheese, margarine, butter, salt, and cayenne in a large bowl. Add
  the flour and mix thoroughly. Roll into a ball and wrap tightly in plastic
  wrap. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.
  
  Divide dough in half, then keep dividing the dough in half until you have
  32 small balls. Place them on an ungreased cookie sheet and flatten with
  the heel of the hand. These do not spread out or rise much during baking,
  so they can be placed fairly close together.
  
  Bake until just golden, about 15 minutes. Allow to cool for just a minute
  before removing with a spatula to a cooling rack.
