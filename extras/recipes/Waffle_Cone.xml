    <directions>
      <step>  Beat the eggs and gradually beat in the sugar until the mixture is creamy.
  Stir in the melted butter and vanilla.
  
  Combine the flour and baking powder, and then add it to the mixture. Blend
  it in well.
  
  Drop about 4 t of the batter into a heated pizelle iron, and cook both
  sides over medium-high heat for about 1 minute each, or until golden brown.
  
  Remove the waffle from the pizelle iron and immediately shape it into a
  cone while it is still pliable.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Waffle ice-cream cone, pizelles -- This recipe comes from a recent issue
  of _Canadian Living_ magazine. Waffle cones look like round waffles shaped
  into a cone and have a wonderful taste. (I admit it, I'm hooked on them.)
  This recipe is actually for a type of cookie called the pizelle, but it
  tastes just like the waffle cones you can get at an ice-cream parlor.
  Yield:  about 20 cones.
  
  *  A pizelle iron looks like a round waffle iron. There are "manual" irons
  and electric ones too.  If you don't have a pizelle iron, another idea is
  to use an ordinary waffle iron and have ice-cream on top of the waffle. Not
  having either a waffle iron or a pizelle iron, we tried making these on an
  electric griddle, but since the batter is fairly thick it wouldn't spread
  into a large enough circle to make cones from.
  
  *  When you form the cones, there will probably be a small hole in the
  bottom of them that ice-cream can drip out of. One idea for plugging this
  hole is to put miniature marshmallows in the bottoms of the cones.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 1-2 minutes (per cone) cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
