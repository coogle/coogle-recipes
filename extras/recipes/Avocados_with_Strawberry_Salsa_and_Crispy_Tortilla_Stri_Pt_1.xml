      <step>  Wearing rubber gloves, remove stems, seeds, and ribs from chili and chop
  fine.
  
  In a bowl stir together chili and remaining salsa ingredients. Salsa may be
  made several hours ahead and chilled, covered.
  
  Stack tortillas and cut them in half. Cut stacks crosswise into
  1/2-inch-thick strips and in a heavy skillet heat 1/2 inch oil over
  moderate heat until hot but not smoking. Working in two batches, fry
  tortilla strips until crisp and golden, about 30 seconds, and with a
  slotted spoon transfer to
  
  paper towels to drain. Sprinkle fried tortilla strips with salt to taste.
  
  Halve the avocado, removing the pit, and peel. Slice each half lengthwise
  into 6 wedges. Slice chicken into 6 wedges and fan ,with the avocado, onto
        2    plates.
  
  Spoon about 1/2 cup strawberry salsa over each fan and mound crispy
  tortilla strips alongside.

  STRAWBERRY CREME CARAMEL TART Recipe By: Cooking Live Show #CL8911
  Categories: Cooking Live, Import
  
  Creme caramel: 1 1/4 cups whole small strawberries (about 30), trimmed 1
  1/4 cups granulated sugar 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 1 large whole egg 3 large
  egg yolks 1 teaspoon vanilla Pastry crust: 1 cup all-purpose flour 2 1/2
  tablespoons packed brown sugar 1/4 teaspoon salt 5 tablespoons unsalted
  butter, cut into pieces and softened slightly 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons ice
  water Garnish: small strawberries
  
  Make creme caramel:
  
  Preheat oven to 225 degrees F. Spread strawberries on a baking sheet and
  bake in middle of oven 30 minutes to dry slightly. Transfer baking sheet to
  a rack to cool strawberries.
  
  Increase temperature to 350 degrees F.
  
  In a dry heavy saucepan cook granulated sugar over moderately low heat,
  stirring slowly with a fork (to help sugar melt evenly), until melted and
  pale golden. Cook caramel, without stirring, swirling pan, until deep
  golden. Immediately pour caramel into a 9-inch glass pie plate, tilting
  plate to coat bottom and sides evenly. Put pie plate in a baking pan.
  
  In a saucepan heat cream just to a boil and remove pan from heat. In a bowl
  whisk together egg, yolks, vanilla, and a pinch of salt until combined well
  and in a stream add warm cream, whisking. Skim off any froth and carefully
  pour custard into pie plate. Arrange strawberries
  
  decoratively on their sides in custard (custard should completely cover
  strawberries) and add enough hot water to pan to reach halfway up side of
  plate. Bake creme caramel in middle of oven about 40 minutes, or until
  custard is just set but still trembles slightly (custard will continue to
  set as it cools). Remove plate from pan and cool custard completely on a
  rack.
  
  Chill creme caramel, loosely covered with plastic wrap, at least 4 hours
  and up to 1 day.
  
  Make crust:
  
  In a large bowl with fingertips or a pastry blender blend together flour,
  brown sugar, salt, and butter until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 1
  tablespoon ice water and toss mixture with a fork until incorporated. Add
  some or all of remaining ice water, 1/2 tablespoon at a time, tossing with
  fork to incorporate until mixture just begins to form a dough. On a work
  surface with heel of hand smear dough in 3 or 4 forward motions to help
  distribute butter. Form dough into a ball and flatten to form a disk. Chill
  dough, wrapped in plastic wrap, 1 hour.
  
  On a lightly floured surface roll out dough into a 10-inch round
