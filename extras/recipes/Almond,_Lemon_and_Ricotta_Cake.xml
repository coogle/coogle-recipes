      <step>  Makes 1 x 25.5cm/10 in cake.
  
  1. Preheat oven to 150C/300F/Gas 2. Butter a 25.5cm/10in round cake tin and
  line with greaseproof paper.
  
  2. Coarsely chop the almonds in a food processor. Combine with the flour
  and lemon zest.
  
  3. Beat the butter and sugar together in a mixer until pale and light. Add
  the egg yolks one by one, then add the almond mixture.
  
  4. Put the ricotta in a bowl and lightly beat with a fork. Add the lemon
  juice. In another bowl, beat the egg whites until they form soft peaks.
  Fold the egg whites into the almond mixture and finally stir in the
  ricotta.
  
  5. Spoon the mixture into the prepared tin and bake in the preheated oven
  for 35-40 minutes until set. Test by inserting a skewer, which should come
  out clean. Remove from tin while warm, and cool on a rack.
  
  NOTES : Go on - just a slice. To serve any time, but especially as a
  new-style pudding. Ricotta is a fresh, soft, mild cheese, traditionally
  made fro mthe whey left behind when the curds had been used for other
  cheeses. It's not so rich as mascarpone, and often used in cooking, as a
  filling for pasta or for sweet or savoury tarts.
