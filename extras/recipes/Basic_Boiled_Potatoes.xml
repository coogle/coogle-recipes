      <step>  1. If the potatoes are refrigerated, take them out of the refrigerator at
  least half an hour before you cook them. Wash them under cold, running
  water, scrubbing off any dirt without breaking the skin, and put them in a
  large kettle that will easily hold all the potatoes. Add enough water to
  cover them by about an inch. Take the potatoes out, cover the kettle, and
  put it over medium-high heat.
  
  2. When the water is nearly but not quite boiling, add the potatoes. Now
  let the water come to a full, rolling boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low
  and cook at a bare simmer until they are tender. It is impossible to give
  exact times; it can take from 10 to 30 minutes, depending on the size and
  age of your potatoes.
  
  3. Drain off all the water and let the potatoes sit, uncovered, in a warm
  place for about 5 minutes. Have a heated bowl ready. Quickly peel the
  potatoes with your hands (don't use a knife or potato peeler), the skins
  will skip right off. Put them in the bowl as they are peeled.
  
  4. Serve them tossed with melted butter, salt, and a liberal grinding of
  black pepper, if desired, or use as directed in other recipes.
  
  NOTES : A side bar says:  Start with good potatoes; The potatoes should be
  be same size (roughly).  Don't cut them to uniform size either, since this
  would expose the inner potato to water.     Resist the temptation to rinse
  the potatoes in cold water to speed the peeling.
