      <step>  Chop the scallions, chilies (half a chili is enough for me), and coriander
  in the food processor. Then add the chicken, flour, eggs, ginger, and salt,
  and process until the chicken is finely chopped and all the ingredients are
  well blended. (I have overprocessed the chicken to a paste by mistake, and
  the result was also delightful). Chill, covered, for 1-2 hours.
  
  Deep-fry by the heaping tablespoon (dip the spoon in oil so that the
  mixture does not stick) in medium-hot oil, turning over once, until browned
  all over. Drain on paper towels. Serve hot or cold.
  
  The recipe makes about fourteen 2 1/2-inch (6-cm) fritters and up to
  thirty-six tiny ones.
  
  VARIATION:
  
  An Indian Baghdadi arook thayin is made with a pinch of turmeric.
  
  SERGIO'S NOTES:
  
  Jews from Calcutta, Cochin, Persia, and Iraq began to settle in Burma, in
  Southeast Asia, in the mid-nineteenth century. It was Jews of Baghdadi
  origin who organized the congregation, and it is their style of cooking
  that influenced the Jewish style that developed locally. During the
  Japanese occupation, almost all the community fled, many of them to India.
  
  This recipe was given to someone I know by Mrs. Philomene Jacobs of the
  Baghdadi community in India. These delectable fritters - soft and creamy,
  gingery and peppery - make splendid finger food. Posted to JEWISH-FOOD
