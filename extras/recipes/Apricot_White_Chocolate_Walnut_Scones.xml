  I noticed someone in here was requesting apricot recipes and someone else
  is partial to white chocolate, so to kill two birds with one scone (ga ka
  ka ka ka) here is a delicious scone recipe from one of my parents'
  cookbooks.  They lived in England for three years, where scones are
  virtually the staff of life.
  
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  In a large bowl, stir together the flour,
  sugar, baking powder, and salt. Cut the butter into 1/2 inch cubes and
  distribute them over the flour mixture. With a pastry blender or two knives
  used scissors fashion, cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse
  crumbs.  In a small bowl, stir together the cream, egg, and vanilla. Add
  the cream mixture to the flour mixture and knead until combined. Knead in
  the white chocolate, walnuts, and apricots.
  
  With lightly floured hands, pat the dough out on a floured work surface to
  a thickness of 5/8 inch.  Cut circles in the dough with a biscuit cutter.
  Gather the scraps of dough together and repeat till all the dough is used.
  Bake scones on ungreased baking sheet for 15 to 20 minutes, or until
  lightly browned on top.  Place baking sheet on wire rack for 5 minutes,
  then transfer scones to wire rack to cool. Serve warm or cool completely
  and store in an airtight container.  Makes 8 or 9 scones.
  
  * (Sue speaking) You can use those "Nestles Treasures" white chocolate
  chips, but before they came out with those, I used to use a Nestle Alpine
  White With Almonds bar, smashed into pieces. I would then omit the walnuts
  and substitute half the vanilla extract with almond extract for a delicious
  variation.
  
  ** To toast walnuts, place the walnuts in a single layer on a baking sheet
  and bake at 375 degrees for 5 to 7 minutes, shaking the sheet a couple of
  times, until the nuts are fragrant.
