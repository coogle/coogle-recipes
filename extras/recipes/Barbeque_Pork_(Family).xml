    <directions>
      <step>   Cut onions in half lengthwise, slice in 1/4" slices, halve the slices and
  separate into rings.  Trim all possible fat from roast and sprinkle with
  garlic salt and seasoned pepper. Place half the onions in crockpot, put in
  roast and top with rest of onions. Pour 1 cup of soda over all, cover and
  cook on LOW for 10 to 12 hours, or overnight until pork can be easily
  shredded with two forks.
   Remove pork from pot, shred in a bowl, removing all possible fat. Remove
  onions with slotted spoon and add to bowl. Discard juice in pot. Return
  onions and pork to pot, add BBQ sauce to all and mix. Continue to cook on
  LOW for 5 to 6 hours, adding more BBQ sauce as needed. Serve as sandwiches
  in buns.  (I use Pepperidge Fram Sandwich rolls).
   Leftovers may be cooled, made into  sandwiches, wrapped in heavy plastic
  wrap and frozen individually for later use. (I store them in the sandwich
  roll bags, 8 to a bag, sealed with the tab that came with the bag). They
  keep well and may be unwrapped, rewrapped in paper towels and heated in a
  microwave at 50% for a few minutes.
   NOTE:  Idea from Laurie Robinson (SNMJ29D) 01/14/93: "I made up a batch of
  BBQ pork but did not have enough rolls to freeze it with. I put globs of it
  on cookie sheets and froze them for a day. Then I put the globs into zip
  lock baggies and popped them in the freezer. I have used a glob on a baked
  potato for lunch (terrific), and sent some to work with my hubby with fresh
  rolls for the microwave.  These globs take very little space in the freezer
  and are very convenient for use." Wonderful idea!
