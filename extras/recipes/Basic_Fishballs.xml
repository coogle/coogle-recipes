      <step>   Fishballs can be used in a variety of ways: they can be deep-fried and
  served with a sweet-and-pungent sauce, combined with stir-fried vegetables,
  or added to soups and red-cooked dishes.
  
   Preparing the fish: Use either fish fillets or whole fish. With the
  latter, have the fish split in half and the head and big bones removed.
  Then, with a spoon or blunt knife, scrape the flesh from the skin. Always
  work from tail to head. (If you work the other way, the fine bones will
  come loose and be difficult to separate out.)
  
   Making the fish mixture: Follow any of the four recipes "Fishball Mixture
  A", B, C or D.
  
   Forming the fishballs: If the fish mixture is moist, take a fistful and
  squeeze it through a hole made by joining thumb and index finger, to form
  walnut-size balls. Or, if the mixture is of a drier consistency, shape the
  fishballs between the palms of the hands. (Moisten the hands first.)
  
   Cooking the fishballs: Bring 4 to 5 cups of water almost to a boil. Add
  fishballs and cook over medium heat until done (3 to 5 minutes). The fish
  liquid may be enriched with 4 beaten egg yolks and 1 teaspoon salt, stirred
  in at the end of cooking, and then served with the fish. Or a fish stock
  may be substituted and the fishballs cooked in it. To prepare stock, simmer
  the fish head and bones in 4 to 5 cups of water for an hour. Then stir in 1
  tablespoon vinegar, a few drops of sherry, and either 1 tablespoon lard or
  a few drops of sesame oil.
  
   Storing fishballs: Fisbballs cannot be stored raw, but must be parboiled
  first. Plunge fishballs, a few at a time, into boiling water and cook until
  they float. Drain and let cool. Place in a large bowl of cold water, cover,
  and refrigerate. The fishballs will keep several days.
  
   NOTE: Two pounds of fish fillets make about 20 fishballs.
