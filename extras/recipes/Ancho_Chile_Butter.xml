      <step>  (Note: New Mexico, pasilla, or California chiles can be substituted for
  ancho chiles.)
  
  1. Put chiles in a bowl and cover with boiling water. When they are
  rehydrated, drain them and put them in a food processor or blender; process
  until finely chopped.
  
  2. In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, melt butter. With machine
  running, add hot butter to chiles in a fine stream. Blend until color is
  homogeneous and mixture is smooth.
  
  3. Let stand at room temperature until butter reaches a spoonable
  consistency. Use immediately, or refrigerate or freeze for later use.
  
  Microwave Version: Complete step 1. Put butter in a glass dish and
  microwave on 100% power until butter is melted, about 45 to 60 seconds.
  Continue with steps 2 and 3.
  
  Makes 1/2 cup.
