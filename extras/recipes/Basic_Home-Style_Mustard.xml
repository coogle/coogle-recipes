  The Seed of a Bright Idea By JOHN ASH
  
  The most basic of mustards is simply a mixture of mustard powder and water.
  This recipe has a little more going for it. Remember that most homemade
  mustards tend to be a bit more runny and more pungent than commercially
  made, but that's their charm. Also, homemade mustard needs to mature at
  least a day, and preferably longer, before being used. When it's first
  made, the flavor will be almost unpleasant. Coarsely grind yellow and brown
  mustard seeds in spice grinder or coffee mill. Mix together with mustard
  powder and water. Allow mixture to stand at least 1 hour. Stir in vinegar,
  brown sugar and salt. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 day before using.
