      <step>  Notes: From Orange County Registar
  
  Cook's note: If you can only find small, 4-ounce disks of brie, push 3
  small wheels next to one another.
  
  Advance preparation: Garlic can be roasted several days in advance and
  stored, airtight, in the refrigerator. You can assemble the brie with the
  garlic, tomatoes and pine nuts a day in advance and store, airtight, in the
  refrigerator.
  
  Preliminaries: Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
  
  1. Cut off 1/4 inch of pointed end of head of garlic (save small pieces for
  another recipe). Place cut side up in a piece of aluminum foil. Place
  rosemary on top. Bring sides of foil up to make a deep bowl, but do not
  enclose garlic completely. Pour olive oil over top of garlic. Bake for
  40-45 minutes in preheated oven. Cool.
  
  2. Squeeze garlic so that the cloves pop out of their papery jackets. They
  should be creamy. Smash them and spread on top of brie (including some of
  the rosemary). Place brie in ovenproof dish. Top with tomatoes and pine
  nuts. Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees.
  
  3. Bake brie until warm and softened, about 13-18 minutes. If topping is
  getting too browned, cover loosely with aluminum foil during last portion
  of baking.
  
  4. Sprinkle slivers of fresh basil on top. Surround with crostini and/or
  apple slices. Garnish with sprigs of fresh herbs and, if using, drained
  imported olives. Provide a spreading knife.
