      <step>  Here's an old time idea that's probably "Mid-Western" enough for ya. This
  is something I picked up from my ex-Mennonite Grandmother in Hutchinson,
  Kasas.  Take four nice thick pork chops and brown 'em on each side. Dice up
  four or so slices of stale bread++or bread dried out in the oven. Mix that
  into a can or so of creamed corn. How many cans you need will vary with the
  brand of corn.  Add about half a chopped up yellow onion and a couple of
  beaten eggs.  Mix the mess well and add salt an pepper to taste. Put the
  browned chops in a greased baking dish, pour the corn mixture over the
  chops and pop 'em in a 325F oven for about an hour. The corn topping should
  come out browned and fairly dry and the chops should be nice and succulent
  with a hint of sweetness from the corn. This is one dish that garlic will
  absolutely ruin!  I've tried all sorts of ways to fancy up this dish but
  have never been successful in improving the original simple recipe. And
  there's not ONE squid tentacle in the whole mess! Posted by Stephen
