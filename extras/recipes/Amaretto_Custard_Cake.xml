      <step>  Heat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and flour 12 cup bundt or angel food cake
  pan.
  
  Beat all ingredients in a large bowl on low speed, scraping bowl
  constantly, 1 minute. Beat on medium speed, scraping bowl occasionally, for
        2    more minutes.
  
  Pour into prepared pan and bake 40-45 minutes, until a wooden pick comes
  out clean.
  
  Cool 15 minutes before removing from pan.  Decorate with frosting, or make
  a glaze of 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, 2 Tbsp milk or cream, liqueur to
  thin.
  
  I'd say that you could use a chocolate cake mix, kahlua or bailey's instead
  of amaretto, then melt a half cup of chocolate chips, 2-3 Tbsp butter and
  maybe a bit of milk or cream, as needed to thin, and drizzle that over the
  top, and it'd look like you spent hours in the kitchen. I &gt;know&lt; that this
  recipe tastes good enough that you need super sensitive taste buds to know
  it started with a mix. Don't ruin it with a commercial frosting, though.
  There's absolutely no possible way to disguise &gt;that&lt; flavor.
