      <step>  This is a recipe I got from the FatFree archives (http://www.fatfree.com)
  and have used several times to rave reviews. After trying several different
  lowfat pie crusts, this is the one I am going to stick with for fruit pies.
  It comes out light and springy. A few of my notes follow the recipe.
  
  &gt;From Nov.'94 _Vegetarian Times_, "Full of Flavor, Low in Fat Pies,"
  recipes by Bryanna Clark Grogan and Jane Weston Wilson.
  
  Pastry for "free form pies" (you wrap the big piece of pastry up over the
  top)
  
  Mix together soymilk, potatoes, syrup or honey, and yeast in a medium bowl
  or a food processor bowl. Let stand 5 minutes. Add salt and flours. If
  using a food processor, process 30 seconds. Otherwise, mix and knead
  mixture on a lightly floured surface 5 minutes.
  
  (It says here to place in oiled bowl and oil top lightly, but I think we
  can figure out alternatives.) Cover and let rise until doubled, about an
  hour. Dough can also be allowed to rise in the 'fridge 2-24 hours. kwvegan

  1. I usually have to add a bit of flour to it because it seems to be a bit
  too sticky to roll out easily.
  
  2. I used non-fat milk instead of the soymilk without a problem.
  
  3. I have used regular flour instead of the wheat and unbleached flour and
  it works just fine.
  
  4. I haven't bothered to oil the bowl. Since the dough is sticky anyway, I
  just peel it off the bowl and sprinkle it with flour when I shape it.
  
  5. The dough rises a bit when it bakes. I spread it too thin on the bottom
  once and the top ended up twice as thick, so make sure you don't skimp on
  the bottom crust, since it is weighted down with the filling.
  
  6. Cover the top loosely with a piece of foil while baking. I would advise
  you to spray the foil lightly with an oil spray so it doesn't stick (yes, I
  made that mistake, too). During the last 10-15 minutes of baking, remove
  the foil to brown the crust. It browns very quickly, so keep an eye on it
  and cover it again if it begins to darken too fast.
