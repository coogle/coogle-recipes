      <step>  1. Preheat oven to 350 F. Spread almonds on a small baking sheet. Place in
  oven and toast 6-8 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove and let cool.
  Coarsely chop toasted almonds
  
  2. In a medium bowl, beat eggs with an electric mixer on high, until
  fluffy. Gradually beat in almond extract and sugar until mixture is thick
  and lemon colored. Scraping down side of bowl frequently. With a rubber
  spatula, fold in cake flour mixed with baking powder and salt just until
  thoroughly combined. Fold in chopped toasted almonds.
  
  3. Grease 10 x 4 inch strip down center of 2 cookie sheets. Spoon half of
  almond mixture down center of each cookie sheet to make a 3 x 10 inch log.
  Bake 30 minutes. Remove from oven, Leave oven on.
  
  4. Let cookies cool on sheets 3-5 minutes, or just until cool enough to
  handle. With a serrated knife, cut each log diagonally into 12 slices.
  Place slices, flat sides down, on cookie sheets and return to oven 5
  minutes. Turn slices over and bake an additional 5-7 minutes longer, or
  until golden on both sides. Remove to racks and let cool completely. Store
  in a tightly covered container.
