  I don't know if you would classify this as a brunch item, but it is very
  good.  We got it out of Food and Wine or the Gourmet magazine around 20
  years ago.
  
  To prepare artichokes, remove the stems, cut 1/2" off of top and snip off
  sharp tips of leaves and cook.  Don't over cook.  Remove chokes of
  artichoke by carefully spreading leaves and pulling out innermost ones and
  scrape away the fuzzy choke with a spoon. To cook shrimp, bring 1 quart
  water to a boil, add 1 tablespoon lemon juice and 2 teaspoons salt. Add
  shrimp and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 3 to 5 minutes till
  shrimp turns pink. Reserve 1/2 cup water shrimp was cooked in, then drain,
  peel and clean the shrimp. Reserve 18 shrimp for garnish. Place remaining
  shrimp in blender with reserved liquid, the remaining 5 tablespoons lemon
  juice, seasonings and 1 cup mayonnaise. Blend until shrimp are broken up,
  chill in refrigerator, where it will become considerably thicker until
  ready to fill artichokes.
