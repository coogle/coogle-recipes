      <step>  Crush  wafers in food processor or blender until finely ground. Melt butter
  and mix with wafers for crust. Press into a 10 inch springform pan with
  your fingers, take care to make the crust as thin as possible with special
  attention to the corners where the crust tends to be a bit thick. Filling:
  Ingredients: 3 large pkg. cream cheese 3/4 cup sugar juice of one large
  lemon             3 grade A large eggs Directions: Blend thoroughly the
  cream cheese, sugar and lemon juice. Mix until smooth . Add eggs and blend
  well.  Pour mixture into crust and bake for 30 to 45 minutes at 350
  degrees. When done the cake will be set (not solid), slightly golden, and
  perhaps split on top. It is better slightly over and not under done. Remove
  from the oven and cool on a rack. It will firm up more on cooling. This is
  an important step...cool for about 45 minutes. Topping: Ingredients: 3 cups
  sour cream 3/4 cup sugar 2 tsp vanilla Directions: Mix sour cream, 3/4 cup
  sugar and vanilla.  Pour on top of cooled cake. Return to 350 degree oven
  for 30 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Refrigerate and cool thoroughly
  (overnight is fine) but at least 5-6 hours). Freezes well. You may serve
  now if you do not care for a glaze or for a killer bodiller glaze....
  Glaze: Ingredients: 1 can (1 lb) sour pitted cherries (packed in water) 1/2
  cup sugar 1 tbs cornstarch 1 tbs lemon juice 2 drops red food coloring
  Directions: Drain cherries, reserving 1/2 cup liquid. Put aside cherries.
  In a saucepan, combine sugar, cornstarch. Add cherry liquid, stir until
  smooth. Bring to a boil over medium heat and boil 1 minute..until thick and
  clear. Remove from heat, let cool slightly. Add lemon juice, cherries, food
  coloring. Cool until still warm but pourable. Pour on top on chilled cheese
  cake. Refrigerate for an hour or so.....While the cake may be prepared a
  day before, do not glaze until the day that you plan to serve. I have also
  used commercially prepared pie fillings as a glaze with good results.
