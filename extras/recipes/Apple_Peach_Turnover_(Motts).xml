      <step>  Heat oven to 375F.
  
  In medium bowl, combine flour and salt.
  
  Using pastry blender or 2 knives, cut shortening into flour mixture until
  particles are size of small peas.
  
  Gradually add water, tossing with fork until mixture is moistened. Gather
  pastry into ball. Divide pastry into 12 pieces. On lightly floured surface,
  roll each piece into 5-inch circle.
  
  In large bowl, combine apple sauce, peaches, sugar, walnuts and 1 teaspoon
  cinnamon; mix well.
  
  Place about 1/4 cup of fruit mixture on half of each pastry circle; brush
  edges with water. Fold over; seal edges with fork. Place on ungreased
  cookie sheet.
  
  In small bowl, combine topping ingredients. Sprinkle over pastries.
  
  Bake at 375F for 30 to 35 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on wire rack.
  
  Notes: Pantry: Mott's Natural Apple Sauce. For a brown crust, brush the
  pastries with milk before sprinkling with the sugar-cinnamon mixture.
