      <step>  Cut beef into small cubes (1x2 inch) and keep chilled until about 1 hour
  before cooking. Set electric fondue to 360 degrees and add oil (be careful
  with hot oil). Each guest is given a plate of raw meat and cooking fork
  (also a separate eating fork). They spear one piece and cook to individual
  preference. It takes a little experimentation. Offer a variety of 4 to 6
  sauces. Bottled or experiment with your own exciting recipes. Serve with
  baked potato, vegetables and a green tossed salad. This is a wonderful
  entertaining meal. Great for conversation and a long evening.
  
  NOTE: It is best to have no more than 6 people cooking in one pot for
  convenience and safety reasons. Also not recommended for children under 8.
