      <step>  Recipe By: Sunset Magazine Prep Time: 15 minutes, plus at least 2 weeks for
  mellowing Makes: About 8 cups of apricot or 7 1/3 cups cherry liqueur
  
  1. Place apricots or cherries, vodka, and sugar in a glass jar (at least
  3-quart size). Stir until sugar is mostly dissolved. Cover tightly and let
  stand at least 2 weeks or up to 2 months; after a few days shake jar until
  sugar completely dissolves. Cherry liqueur may form a slightly cloudy,
  harmless residue at the top of the jar.
  
  2. Pour lqueur and fruit, a portion at a time, through a fine strainer into
  a pitcher, letting fruit drain completely. Save fruit for other uses
  (recipe suggestion follows later). Line strainer with four layers of damp
  cheesecloth, set over a spouted container, and pour liqueur through it. Or
  for maximum clarity, strain liqueur through a coffee filter, changing
  filter often (takes several hours).
  
  3. Pour liqueur into small airtight bottles. Serve liqueur, or store
  uptight up to 6 months. (If storing in containers with rubber stoppers,
  place a couple of layers of plastic wrap between rubber and bottle to keep
  alcohol from softening rubber).
  
  Notes: Slab apricots are the sweetest dried apricots; they're picked
  extra-ripe and soft, and are slightly misshapen. Inexpensive vodka works
  fine.
  
  Serving Ideas for Fruit Liqueurs:
  
  * Drizzle over ice cream for an instant but elegant dessert * Add a little
  to mixed fresh fruit, spoon over pound cake * Splash into sparkling wine
  for a festive aperitif * Flavor holiday fruit cakes with liqueur instead of
  rum * Sip and smack your lips happily
