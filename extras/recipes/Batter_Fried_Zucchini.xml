  Get the ready made pancake batter mix and mix it with enough water to make
  a thick batter. Slice the zucchiniabout 1/8 thick. Heat the oil to hot but
  not smoking, Dip each slice of zucchini in the batter and fry until golden
  on each side, salt while you drain. Make 2 times what you need because they
  will be eaten as you fry.
