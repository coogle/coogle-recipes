  1. Preheat oven to 375'F. If you would like to make your own graham-cracker
  crumbs, pulverize crackers in blender or in food processor with knife blade
  attached as manufacturer directs; or place them in sturdy plastic bag and
  roll into fine crumbs with rolling pin.
  
  2. In pie plate or bowl, mix crumbs with remaining ingredients. If you
  like, set aside 3 tablespoons mixture for topping. With hand, press mixture
  onto bottom and up side of pie plate.
  
  3. Bake crust 8 minutes; cool on wire rack. Fill as recipe directs or with
  chilled pie filling; top with reserved crumb mixture or garnish as recipe
  directs.
