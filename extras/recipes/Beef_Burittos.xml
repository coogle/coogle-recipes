    <directions>
      <step>  place first four ingredients in crock pot and cook on low for at least 6-7
  hours.
  
  place meat in tortillas and roll into burritos, then wrap individually in
  foil. Make sure to get some juice in the buritto. Heat oven to 350 degrees
  and bake 10 minutes. This is the trick because the juice soaks into the
  buritto.
  
  I have also used pork and chicken in these and they are great, but make
  sure to use chicken with skin so it isn't dry. I have also substituted
  salsa verde for the tomatoes when using the pork for an easy chili verde
  burrito. Try these they are really good,
