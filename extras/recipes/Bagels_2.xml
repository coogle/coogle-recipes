      <step>  Combine yeast, salt, 2 teaspoons sugar and 1 1/2 cups flour in a large
  bowl.  Heat potato water and salad oil in saucepan over low heat until very
  warm (120 - 130F).  At low speed, beat this liquid into dry ingredients
  until just blended.  Increase speed to medium and beat 2 minutes, scraping
  down bowl.  Beat in 2 eggs and 1/2 cup flour to form a thick batter. Beat 2
  minutes and scrape down bowl. Stir in about 2 cups flour to make a soft
  dough. Knead on lightly floured board until smooth and elastic, about 10
  minutes.  Add more flour while kneading, as needed.  Shape dough into ball
  and place in greased bowl; turn dough over to grease top. Cover with moist
  towel and rise in warm place until double, about
    1 1/2    hours.
  
  Punch down dough and cut dough into 16 pieces on lightly floured surface.
  Cover with moist towel and rest for 20 minutes.  Roll each piece into 8
  inch long strip.  Form into rings and place 2 inches apart on 2 greased
  cookie sheets.  Cover with moist towel and let rise in warm place for 30
  minutes (dough will NOT be doubled).
  
  Preheat oven to 425F.  In a 12 inch skilled, bring 1 inch of water and 2
  tablespoons sugar to a boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to medium and drop
  a few rings in at a time and simmer for 3 minutes, turning once. Remove
  rings to paper towels.  Drain.  Place on cookie sheets. Beat remaining egg
  slightly and brush over rings.  Bake 20 to 25 minutes until light brown.
  Cool 5 minutes on wire rack. Cut in half across the width and toast to
  serve.
  
  Makes 16 bagels.
