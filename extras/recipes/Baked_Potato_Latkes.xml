      <step>  The following recipes appeared last year in the N.Y.Daily News. The second
  recipe is from Helen Nash, a well-known New York writer of kosher
  cookbooks. (Printed by Random House)
  Set oven racks to lowest and highest positions.  Pre-heat oven to 450
  degrees.  Brush 2 heavy baking sheets with 2 teaspoons of oil each.  Peel
  and cut the onion into quarters and chop very finely in a food processor
  fitted with the steel blade. Empty onion into a bowl. Using the fine
  shredding blade of a food processor, grate potatoes finely and add them to
  the onion.
  
  Add flour, salt and pepper; toss with 2 forks to mix well.  Add whole egg,
  egg white and remaining teaspoon oil; mix.
  
  Warm baking sheets: If  size of oven permits, place both oiled sheets side
  by side in upper rack of pre-heated oven, because lower rack will burn oil.
  Drain potato mixture, if necessary, and drop level tablespoons of potato
  mixture onto the prepared warm baking sheets and press lightly to flatten.
  
  Bake on lowest rack, side by side, for 10 minutes, or until golden brown on
  bottom.  Turn over and bake for 5 minutes longer, or until they seem
  cooked.
  
  This side will not get brown or very crisp.  Transfer to platter, arranging
  latkes browned side up. Note: Cooked latkes may be refrigerated. Reheat at
  350 degrees for about 10 minutes, or until hot. They also can be
  frozen,properly wrapped, and heated without thawing at 400 degrees for
  about 10 minutes, or until hot.
