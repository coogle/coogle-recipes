      <step>  fennel plant, which resembles celery with fern like tops, has been called
  sweet anise in produce markets. The true anise is cultivated only for its
  seeds. So what you see labelled "sweet anise" in your market is probably
  fennel, but no matter what you call it, this is a highly interesting
  vegetable.  Every part of this aromatic plant has a taste and aroma similar
  to licorice. The stems are eaten like celery,uncook, or cooked and served
  as a vegetable (heavenly with apples in waldorf salad) Available from
  September to May.
  
  HOW TO CHOOSE AND STORE:  Choose fennel the same way you do celery, with
  crisp stalks and fresh leaves. Wash and store in vegetable crisper or
  plastic bag in refrigerator.
  
  BASIC PREPARATION: Trim the ferny tops and remove tough outer stalks. Cut
  off heavy base.  Slice the stalks in thin lengthwise strips. Wash,drain and
  cook in boiling, salted water or bouillon until just tender,15-20 minutes.
  Drain and add melted butter, salt and pepper and serve.
