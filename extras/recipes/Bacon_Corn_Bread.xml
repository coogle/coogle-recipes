    Bacon was one meat that would keep fairly well during the long trip on
  the trail, providing you kept it in bags surrounded by bran. The bran would
  help prevent the bacon fat from melting under the heat of the prairie sun.
  This dish offers a new flavor, which must have been truly delicious after a
  day in that wagon!
  
    Cook the bacon until crisp. Reserve the fat. Chop the bacon and stir it
  into the corn bread batter. Use bacon fat instead of shortening, if you
  wish, to make the batter.
  
    Grease the pan with a good bit of the bacon fat and bake the corn bread
  as directed.
