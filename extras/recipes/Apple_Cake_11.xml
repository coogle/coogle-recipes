      <step>  Apple Cake: 1-3 hours steaming at the edge of the fire. Tools: Large pot
  for steaming with a lid or alumimum foil to cover; 2-3 quart pot with lid
  or heavy duty foil to seal top -  that fits inside the large pot (nestled
  pot kit works well). Prepare in advance: Mix together the flour, dried egg
  mix, dried milk powder, baking powder, salt, and 1 tablespoon granulated
  sugar. With two knives, cut the shortening into the flour until mixture is
  mealy.  Store in a zip lock bag, Peel the apples and slice them. Put them
  in a zip lock bag with 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and any finely chopped
  lemon peel that is available. Apple mixture may be frozen. Mix the
  cinnamon, nutmeg, and t tablespoons of  sugar and stone in a small ziplock
  bag. At the camp site: Make a well in the center of the flour mixture in
  the bag and add the water. Stir the mixture to form smooth batter, turn
  into greased smaller pot. Arrange the apples in rows on top, pushing them
  halfway into the dough.  Sprinkle over the apples and dot with apricot jam.
  Cut small pieces of  butter over all. Cover the cake pot  with lid or heavy
  duty foil.  Put the smaller pot inside the larger one and fill along the
  sides with hot water until the water is about 2/3 or 3/4 of the way up the
  sides of the cake pot.  Place the lid on the large pot and place it on the
  edge of the fire so the water simmers and just boils.  Check from time to
  time and add more water as it boils down.  As long as the water does not
  boil dry, this cannot be overcooked.

  NOTES : Chicken breasts should be boneless and skinless. Hormel precooked
       bacon is available in small bottles at K-Mart, and in larger
       canisters at Costco.
       Raw bacon can be used and cooked with the onions.
       Up to 1 pound of velvetta cheese can be used
       Use of mexican flavored velvetta adds flavor options.  Use Hot
       Mexican only if all who will eat it agree.
