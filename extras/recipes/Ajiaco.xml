      <step>  This recipe is for a Cuban stew/soup that I used to enjoy con mucho gusto.
  This version of Ajiaco was prepared by Senora Garcia in her little store
  front restaurant on Collins Ave. in Miami Beach. Although this is not her
  exact recipe, it's the closest I could get to it.
  
  Melt the butter in a 6 qt. pot over medium heat. Cook chicken pieces in the
  butter until no longer pink. Remove chicken with slotted spoon and place in
  in a bowl. Put onion, garlic, cayenne, and paprika in pot and cook while
  stirring, until onion is translucent and colored with the paprika. Add
  stock, milk, yuca, corn, and chicken to the pot. Bring almost to a boil
  then reduce heat, cover and simmer, stirring every now and then, for about
  1 hour, or until yuca is tender. Remove from heat and stir in lime juice.
  Serve with Cuban or French bread that has been sliced and broiled until
  golden.
  
  As an alternative, frozen corn on the cob will work, as well fresh frozen
  kernels. The fresh corn cob seems to impart a nice flavor to this dish.
  
  If you're wondering what to do with the wheels of corn, just pick 'em up
  with your fingers and nibble 'round the rims.
  
  This dish received rave reviews at the 1991 Blind Pass Marina Xmas Party.
