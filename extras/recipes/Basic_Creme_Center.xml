      <step>  Mix first 2 ingred. &amp; let set overnight &lt;or for several hours&gt; tightly
  covered. Add cream &amp; whip with heavy duty mixer or by hand. Divide dough
  into separate bowls. &lt;I divide into 3&gt;. Makes nice batch of each. For each
  bowl, add whatever color/flavor, etc you like. Below are some ideas:
  Vanilla cremes: add vanilla ****to taste. Chocolate cremes: add melted dark
  chocolate to taste. Mint center: add drops of peppermint oil &amp; pink
  coloring. Black Walnut center: add drops black walnut oil &amp; bl walnuts.
  Peanutbutter cremes: add smooth or crunchy peanut butter. Pineapple cremes:
  add drops pineapple oil, chopped candied pineapple &amp; chopped pecans. Jelly:
  add fruit "flavored" jelly into candy mold with matching flavored oil
  w/creme center. Nut center: wrap creme center mix around a nut meat as
  filling; dip in white/tinted, or milk chocolate. Chocolate covered cherries
  &lt;cream type:&gt; wrap creme center  mix around a well-drained marachino
  cherry...be sure the cherry is SEALED in the dough, chill &amp; dip in choc.*
  Be sure to dip as soon as removing from fridge. The acid in the cherry
  causes it to start cordialing &lt;liquifying&gt; quickly. Will liquify some, but
  some will remain "creamy" because of the butter. Coconut cremes: add
  maccaroon coconut &amp; drops or coconut oil For any dipped cremes: Form 1"
  balls, let crust over &amp; dip in compound coating chocolate. This is also
  called "dipping chocolate." I prefer the brand "Merckens." It seems to take
  more abuse/ reheating, or getting too hot, etc. Dolores McCann, Hamilton
