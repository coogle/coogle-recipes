  ~- Several hours (or a day) before you are going to bake these, make dough:
  . Sift flour into large mixing bowl. . Using pastry blender or two knives,
  cut in 1 pound of the butter butter and the cream cheese until mixture
  resembles large flakes of cornmeal, with several pieces the size of small
  peas. . Form into a large bowl. . Encase in plastic wrap and refrigerate
  for several hours. (Overnight is fine.)
  
  ~- When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
  
  ~- Make filling: . Put remaining 1 stick butter into 3-quart saucepan. .
  Cook over low heat until melted. . Turn off flame under pot. . Add
  granulated sugar and lemon juice. Using wooden spoon, stir until smooth. .
  Add walnuts. Continue mixing until thoroughly blended. . Set aside for
  filling.
  
  ~- Prepare pastries: . Sprinkle powdered sugar over working surface. . Roll
  cold dough between palms of hands into approximately 96 walnut-sized balls.
  . Using rolling pin, flatten each ball of dough into a circle approximately
  3 1/2 inches in diameter. . Place 1 heaping teaspoonful walnut filling in
  center of each ball of dough. . Roll each ball of dough into a log (jelly
  roll fashion). . Gently shape dough into a crescent. . Arrange on ungreased
  cookie sheets.
