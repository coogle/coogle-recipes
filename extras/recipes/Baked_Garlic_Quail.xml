      <step>  Wish I could show you all the picture of this dish. The quail are a
  gorgeous deep reddish orange in color. I imagine that this would be a great
  recipe to use on chicken wings. And they'd definitely be hot++ check out
  the amount of sambal oelek, the Indonesian condiment made of crushed bird's
  eye chilies, garlic and vinegar. I'm making this tomorrow with a hacked up
  chicken and a double recipe of the marinade. I'll start marinating it
  tonight. It would probably be great with a game hen as well. Stay tuned++a
  report will follow.
  
  1: Cut quail in half through centres. Combine garlic, sambal oelek, honey,
  sauce, sugar and oil in bowl, add quail, stir well; cover, refrigerate
  overnight.
  
  2: Just before serving, place quail on rack over baking dish, bake in
  moderate oven for 15 minutes, increase temperature to hot, cook further 10
  minutes or until quail are crisp and tender.
  
  Makes 4 servings.
  
  Quail can be prepared 2 days ahead.
  
  Storage: Covered, in refrigerator. Freeze: Uncooked quail suitable.
  Microwave: Not suitable.
