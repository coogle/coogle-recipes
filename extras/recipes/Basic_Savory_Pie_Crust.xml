    <directions>
      <step>  Combine the flour and salt in a bowl. Add the lard and work it in with your
  hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the water, 1
  tablespoon at a time, working it in with your hands. Add only as much as
  you need to make a smooth ball of dough. Wrap it in plastic wrap and
  refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Remove the dough from the refrigerator
  and place it on a lightly floured surface. For 2 crusts, cut the dough in
  two and put the second half back in the refrigerator. For each crust, roll
  the dough out on the floured surface into a circle about 12 inches in
  diameter and 1/8-inch thick. Gently fold the circle of dough in half and
  then in half again so that you can lift it without tearing it, and unfold
  into a 9-inch pie pan. Fill and proceed as directed in the recipe. This
  recipe yields two 9-inch pie crusts.
