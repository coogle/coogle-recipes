      <step>  "A tasty and nutritious teething cracker, far superior
  to anything you will find for sale at the supermarket.
  These make thoughtful gifts for babies and their
  parents. For an alternative baby teething cracker, try
  the Zwieback recipe on page 139. 325~F. 60 to 70
  minutes Preheat the oven to 325~F.
  
  In the food processor or in a large bowl, stir
  together the flour, corn meal, salt, and sugar. Add
  the egg and mix well. Blend in enough of the milk to
  form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive
  ball.
  
  On a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll into a
  rectangle about 3/8 inch thick. With a sharp knife,
  cut the dough into 1-1/2- by 3-inch rectangles. Place
  them on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking
  sheet. Prick each cracker 2 or 3 times with the tines
  of a fork.
  
  Bake for 60 to 70 minutes, or until the crackers are
  thoroughly dry. Cool on a rack. These crackers should
  be hard. If necessary, put them back in the oven for a
  few extra minutes. Yield: 10-15. Converted by MMCONV
