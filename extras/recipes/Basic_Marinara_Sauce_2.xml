      <step>  Place the oil and garlic into a 2 quart saucepan and heat just until
  the aroma of the garlic releases - DON'T overcook the garlic (it
  shouldn't even turn brown)!  Pour in the crushed tomatoes and set
  heat to simmer Stir in the sugar until disolved Stir in the oregano
  and parsley Simmer for fifteen minutes
  
  NOTES : Dried oregano can be used if you don't have fresh, but it
  definitely affects the flavor.  This sauce can be used as a base for a
  variety of recipes - its great as a pizza sauce; loves to have things
  added to it like pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms etc. and is even
  better after it has set for a day.
  
  Cooking Tip: When removing the cover from a simmering pot of tomato
  sauce, don't let the condensation from the lid drip back into the
  sauce. Its acidity will effect the flavor.
