      <step>  Wolfert writes: "If you run out of preserved lemons, or decide on just a
  few day's notice to cook a chicken, lamb, or fish dish with lemons and
  olives and need preserved lemons in a hurry, you can use this quick
  five-day method taught to me by a Moroccan diplomat's wife. Lemons
  preserved this way will not keep, but are perfectly acceptable in an
  emergency."
  
  With a razor blade, make 8 fine 2" vertical incisions around the peel of
  each lemon to be used. (Do not cut deeper than the membrane that protects
  the pulp.)  Place the incised lemons in a stainless-steel saucepan with
  plenty of salt and water to cover and boil until the peels become very
  soft.  Place in a clean jar, covered with cooled cooking liquor, and leave
  to pickle for approximately 5 days.
