      <step>  Basic Pizza Crust
  
  From: Cooking Light magazine, Sept./Oct. 1991 issue
  
  Dissolve sugar and yeast in 1 cup warm water in a large bowl; let stand 5
  minutes. Stir in 2 3/4 cups flour, salt, and oil to form a soft dough.
  
  Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth and
  elastic (about 5 minutes); add enough of remaining flour, 1 Tablespoon at a
  time, to prevent dough from sticking to hands.
  
  Place dough in a bowl coated with cooking spray, turning dough to coat top.
  Cover dough and let rise in a warm place (85 deg.F.), free from drafts, 1
  hour or until doubled in bulk.
  
  Punch dough down, and divide in half. Roll each half of dough into a 12
  inch circle on a lightly floured surface. Place dough on 12-inch pizza pans
  or baking sheets coated with cooking spray and each sprinkled with 1/2
  Tablespoon cornmeal. Crimp edges of dough with fingers to form a rim. Cover
  and let rise in a warm place (85 deg.F.), free from drafts, 30 minutes. Top
  and bake according to recipe directions. Yield: 2 (12-inch) pizza crusts
  (about 720 calories each).
  
  Note: Store half of dough in freezer up to 1 month, if desired. Let dough
  rise; punch down, and divide in half. Dust half with flour, wrap in plastic
  wrap, and store in a zip-top heavy-duty plastic bag in freezer. To thaw,
  place dough in refrigerator 12 hours or overnight; bring to room
  temperature, and shape as desired.
