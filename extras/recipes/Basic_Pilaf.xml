      <step>  Saute rice, stirring constantly, in hot oil or butter in nonstick pan until
  translucent, about 2 minutes. Combine rice and broth in steaming pan;
  season to taste. Cover and steam until the rice is done, 18 to 20 minutes.
  Uncover and allow to dry out, 3 to 5 minutes. Fluff with fork before
  serving.
  
  Variations: * Soak rice in hot water; allow to cool; drain and proceed with
  recipe. Turkish cooks consider this step necessary for a fluffier rice.
  
  * Although not typical, pilaf may be flavored with onion and garlic.
  
  * Pilaf may be sprinkled with finely chopped parsley or paprika to taste
  just before serving.
  
  * Like their neighbors in Italy, Greeks love tomatoes so they can sometimes
  add the flavor to pilaf. Saute 1/2 cup finely chopped onion in oil. Add 1/2
  cup finely chopped tomato or tomato sauce to rice and broth in steaming
  pan. Onion may be omitted.
