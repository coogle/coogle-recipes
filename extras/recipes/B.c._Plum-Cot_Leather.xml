      <step>  Wash, pit and chop fruit.  Puree in blender with sugar. Yields 3 1/2 to 4
  cups.  Prepare 15 1/2 x 10 1/2 inch cookie sheet or jelly roll pan by
  covering with plastic wrap and securing with masking tape. Pour puree
  evenly over the plastic.  Place in full sunlight. Drying time depends on
  the fruit, temperature and sunlight.
  
  If not quite dry after the first day, bring indoors overnight and continue
  drying the next day.  It may take up to 24 hours. Drying may be finished in
  the oven if weather is unsuitable for sun drying. Pre-heat oven to the
  lowest setting 150F.  Turn off.  Set puree in middle. Occasionally reheat
  to maintain warmth.
  
  The leather is ready when it peels easily from the plastic. To store, roll
  in the plastic wrap, then in a sealed bag. At room temperature it will keep
  one month. In the fridge, 3 months. 27 servings
