    <directions>
      <step>  Combine 2 cups of the flour and the yeast. Add warm water, 3 tbsp of the
  sugar, and 1 tsp of salt. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed for 30
  seconds, scraping bowl constantly. Beat on high speed for 3 minutes. Using
  a spoon, stir in as much remaining flour as you can.
  
  Turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead in enough reamining flour to
  make a moderately stiff dough that is smooth and elastic (6-8 min total).
  Cover; let rest 10 min. Working quickly, divide dough into 12 portions.
  ***Shape each into a smooth ball. Punch a hole in the center of each ball.
  
  Pull dough gently to make a 2" hole, keeping bagel uniformly shaped.***
  Place on a greased baking sheet. Cover; let rise 20 min.
  
  Broil raised bagels about 5" from heat for 3-4 min, turning once (tops
  should not brown). Meanwhile, in a 12" skillet or 4 1/2 qt. Dutch oven
  bring 6 cups water and remaining 1 tbsp sugar to boiling. Reduce heat and
  simmer bagels, four or five at a time, for 7 min, turning once. Drain on
  paper towels. Place on well-greased baking sheet. Bake at 375x for 25 to 30
  min ortill tops are golden brown.
  
  Makes 12 bagels.
  
  VARIATIONS
  
  LIGHT RYE BAGELS: Stir 1 tsp caraway seed in with the yeast. Substitute 1
  1/2 cups rye flour for 1 1/2 cups of the stirred-in flour.
  
  HERB BAGELS: Stir 1 1/2 tsp dried basil, crushed; 1 1/2 tsp dried dillweed;
  or 1-1 1/2 tsp garlic powder in with the yeast.
  
  ONION BAGELS: Stir 2 tbsp dried minced onion and, if desired, 2 tbsp cooked
  bacon pieces into the flour with the yeast.
  
  WHOLE WHEAT BAGELS: Substitute 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour for 1 1/2 cups
  of the stirred-in flour. Add 3/4 cup of raisins if desired.
  
  NOTES : ** I prefer to roll the dough in a rope and wrap it around my hand
  to form the bagels.
