      <step>  Mix sugars. Boil milk with half of sugars for two minutes. Let it cool
  down. (For the milk it is easiest to use a pot which can later be used with
  a mixer.) Mix well (mixer at high speed) the yolks with the other half of
  the sugars. Using mixer add to milk. Then (still using mixer) add alcohol
  slowly. (The result is quite fluid, sweet and strong.) Bottle and let rest
  for two weeks to let the mixture thicken.
  Notes: Advokaat is the Dutch word for "egg cognac". It is highly
  recommended for A. I. (Alcohol Imbibing) meetings. This recipe is my
  modification of a recipe I obtained in Poland. It makes a potent, superb
  advokaat (or egg - cognac). The milk and eggs are healthy, the sugar and
  alcohol are not.  This advokaat can be drunk or, better yet, eaten with a
  spoon: it is quite thick.
