  COOKING DIRECTIONS
  ==================
  Boil water.  Stir in barley and salt, if desired.  Cover; reduce heat.

  Remove from heat; let stand 5 minutes.
  
  HELPFUL HINTS
  * To store cooked barley:
    Refrigerate barley in tightly covered container up to 1 week.  Or,
    freeze in tightly covered container bag up to 6 months.
  
  * To reheat cooked barley:
    MICROWAVE: Remove barley from freezer container or bag.  Place in
    microwavable container.  For each cup of barley, sprinkle with 2
    tablespoons water; cover.  Microwave on HIGH 2 to 3 minutes,
    stirring half way through cooking.
  
    STOVETOP: Place barley in heavy saucepan.  For each cup of barley,
    sprinkle with 2 tablespoons water; cover.  Cook over low heat 5 to 8
    minutes or until heated through, stirring occasionally.
  
  * For a new twist --
    ~~ toss cooked barley into salads
    ~~ stir cooked barley into soups and stews
    ~~ mix cooked barley with stir-fried vegetables
