    <directions>
      <step>  Long, slow marinating in garlicky yogurt tenderizes, moistens and adds deep
  flavor, so you end up with skinless grilled chicken that's as delicious as
  it is nutritionally correct. Serve with soft pita or Arab flatbread and
  fresh yogurt.
  
  Put the salt in a wide, shallow non-reactive bowl with the garlic and mash
  them together until you have paste. Add yogurt, lemon and pepper.
  
  Skin the chicken breasts, remove all visible fat and separate the halves.
  Bend each backward to break the bones so the pieces win lie flat. Add to
  the yogurt and turn so all surfaces are well-coated.
  
  Cover the bowl tightly and refrigerate. Allow to marinate at least
  overnight, up to a day and a half. Turn when you think of it.
  
  To cook, remove breasts from marinade and wipe off all but a thin film.
  Broil or grill about 6 inches from the heat for 6 to 8 minutes a side, or
  until thoroughly cooked. Meat will brown somewhat but should not char.
  Serve at once.
