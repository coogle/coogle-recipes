      <step>  In a large sauce pan, blanch basil leaves for 5 seconds. Refresh in an ice
  bath and squeeze out any excess liquid. Place leaves and oil in a blender
  and puree.
  
  First, strain the puree through a fine mesh sieve. Then line a small
  strainer with several layers of cheesecloth and strain oil into a glass
  jar. Flavored oil keeps, covered loosely and refrigerated at all times, 1
  month.
