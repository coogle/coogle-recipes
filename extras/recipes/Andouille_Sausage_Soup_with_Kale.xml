      <step>  I made this soup at work tonight and thought I'd share the recipe since it
  really is outstanding. It's adapted from a recipe I saw that used Chorizzo.
  What really struck me was that the kale was really good in this soup. At my
  restaurant we make a strong turkey stock for a means to heat our turkey for
  hot sandwiches and turkey dinners. This is what I used but a good chicken
  stock will work just as well.
  
  Heat the oil in a 1 quart sauce pan over medium high heat. Just as the oil
  starts to smoke throw in the onion, bell pepper, celery and stir the pan.
  This will cool the oil but it will quickly re-heat. Keep stiring for 2 min.
  then add the Andouille sausage and cook till the sausage starts to brown
  around the edges and give up some of it's fat to the pan. Add the garlic
  and chile flakes and cook for 2 min. more stiring constantly. Add the kale
  and stir till coated by everything in the pan. Add the turkey stock and
  bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer for 20 min. Check seasoning and
  adjust with salt and pepper. Posted to FoodWine Digest by stephen walls
