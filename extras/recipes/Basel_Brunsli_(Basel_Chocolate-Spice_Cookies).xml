    <directions>
      <step>  Heat oven to 325F.  Line several baking sheets with aluminum foil.
  
  In a food processor, process the almonds and 1 cup powdered sugar until the
  almonds are powder-fine but not oily; stop the processor and scrape down
  the sides several times.  Add the cocoa powder, cinnamon, cloves, and
  chocolate; continue processing until the chocolate is finely ground.  Add
  the remaining 1/2 cup powdered sugar, the almond extract, and egg whites;
  process until the mixture is blended and just forms a mass.  Set the dough
  aside for 5 to 10 minutes to stiffen slightly.
  
  Generously dust a work surface with powdered sugar.  If the dough seems too
  soft to roll out easily, dust it with more sugar and knead until the
  consistency is manageable, but avoid adding any more sugar than absolutely
  necessary.  Roll out the dough to 1/4 inch thickness, lifting it with a
  spatula frequently and redusting the surface and rolling pin with powdered
  sugar to prevent sticking.  Cut out the cookies using a 2 1/4-inch
  heart-shaped (or similar) cutter.  Use a spatula to transfer the cookies to
  the prepared baking sheets, about 1 inch apart.
  
  Bake the cookies for 9 to 12 minutes or until almost firm on top and
  slightly puffy.  Let them stand on the foil lined baking sheets until
  completely cooled.  Peel from the foil.  Store airtight for 3 to 4 days.
  Freeze, airtight, for longer storage.
  
  Makes about forty 2 1/4-inch cookies.
