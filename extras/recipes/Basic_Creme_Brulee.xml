      <step>  Combine the first 4 ingredients, stirring with a wire whisk until sugar
  dissolves and mixture is smooth. Carefully pour the egg mixture evenly into
  5 (5x1) round baking dishes or custard cups. Place in a roasting pan large
  enough to accomodate the dishes and add 1/2-inch of water to the roasting
  pan. This step creates a water bath to prevent curdling. Bake at 275 for 45
  to 50 minutes or until almost set. Cool the custards in the water in the
  pan set on a wire rack. Remove from pan when cooled, cover and refrigerate
  overnight. When ready to serve, sprinkle about 1 1/2 tablespoons brown
  sugar evenly over each custard; place each custard on a cookie sheet or
  jelly-roll pan. Broil 5 inches from heat. If using an electric oven, leave
  door partially open. Broil until the sugar melts. Let stand 5 minutes to
  allow sugar to harden.
  
  NOTES:
  
  Handle with care. These are extremely hot. Place custards as close to heat
  source as possible. To achieve a "cracked" effect, broil custards in a pan
  full of ice. Dixie Crystals sugar is reputedly the best for making this
  dessert. ***When finished cooking, the center will still be slightly
  liquid.
