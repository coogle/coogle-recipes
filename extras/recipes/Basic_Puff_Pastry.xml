      <step>  Recipe by: Southern Living Preparation Time: 1:00 Cut 1/4 cup butter into
  1-3/4 cups flour with pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal.
  Sprinkle cold water (1 tablespoon at a time) evenly over surface; stir with
  a fork until dry ingredients are moistened. Shape into a ball, and wrap in
  waxed paper.  Chill 15 minutes. Combine 3/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup flour;
  stir until smooth.  Shape mixture into a 6-inch square on waxed paper.
  Chill 5 minutes.
  
  Roll pastry into a 15-inch circle on a lightly floured surface; place
  chilled butter mixture in center of pastry. Fold left side of pastry over
  butter; fold right side of pastry over left. Fold upper and lower edges of
  pastry over butter, making a thick square. Working quickly, place dough,
  folded side down, on a lightly floured surface; roll dough into a 20- x
  8-inch rectangle.  Fold rectangle into thirds, beginning with short side.
  Roll pastry into another 20- x 8-inch rectangle; again fold rectangle into
  thirds.  Wrap dough in wax paper, and chill about 2 hours. Repeat rolling,
  folding, and chilling process 2 additional times. Chill for 2 hours. Yield:
  one recipe Basic Puff Pastry.
