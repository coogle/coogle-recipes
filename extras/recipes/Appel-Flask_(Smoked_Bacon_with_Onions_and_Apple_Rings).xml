      <step>  Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a heavy skillet. When foam subsides add the
  bacon. Fry 5 to 10 minutes or until the bacon is lightly browned. Remove
  from skillet and set on paper towels to drain. Fry the onion slices for 6
  to 8 minutes in the fat remaining in the skillet, adding more butter as
  necessary. When the onions are soft and transparent, add the apple rings
  and cover the pan. Simmer over low heat for 5 to 10 minutes, shaking the
  pan gently at intervals to prevent the apples from sticking. When the apple
  rings are sufficiently cooked (they should offer little or no resistence
  when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife or skewer), return the drained
  bacon to the skillet. Cover and simmer an additional 3 to 5 minutes or
  until the bacon is heated through. Grind fresh black pepper liberally over
  the top and serve directly from the pan as a luncheon entrâ€še or Sunday
  night supper.
