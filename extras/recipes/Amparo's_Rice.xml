  Hi!  I was making Amparo's rice and it suddenly occurred to me that you
  would probably really enjoy it.  That is assuming I am right that you are
  one of the chili-heads? I am not on the list and I doubt that this recipe
  has made it there (possible tho - my brother is on the net and he should be
  on the list). Anyway, here it is. If you like, pass it on the list. It is
  probably not as hot as some of you like but substitute hotter peppers or
  skim milk for some of the cream and it will heat up. As it is, I use 1
  pepper and, if I want it really mild, I skip the peeling process and just
  core it.  As a side note, today I used 2 old sandwich bags instead of
  gloves, one became the garbage sack and the other is now in the freezer
  with 3 small strips of pepper for next week's stir fry.
  
  (Bahia de Kino, Sonora, Mexico)
  
  Peel and core 1 to 2 jalapeno peppers.  Cut pepper into narrow strips.
  Place on top of 1 cup (I use Basmati) rice in a star pattern.  Add 1 cup
  milk and 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups of half and half. Salt to taste. Bake for
  about 1 hour at 350 degrees or until milk is gone and rice is soft. Serve
  hot.
