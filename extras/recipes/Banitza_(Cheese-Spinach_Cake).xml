  I use filo or puffpastry dough, but still remember the large sheets of fine
  dough my mother was preparing, they were so crunchy , Mmm !
  
  Crumble the feta cheese, and mixe well with the spinach. (mother adds also
  parsley) Place one sheet of filo in a round cake pan, brush with butter,
  cover with another sheet, and repeat the procedure 3-4 times. Then spread
  evenly 1/4 of spinach-cheese mixture, cover with 2 more greased filo, and
  repeat. The top should be covered with 2-3 sheets of filo. Bake for about
  20-30 minutes to a nice golden brown crust.
  
  Serve hot with plain yogurt.
