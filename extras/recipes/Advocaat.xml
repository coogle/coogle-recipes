    <directions>
      <step>  Beat the egg yolks, fine sugar and vanilla extract until the mixture turns
  a very smooth, pale yellow colour. The mixture will be quite thick in its
  consistency. Add the Brandewijn very slowly, keeping your mixer at the
  lowest possible speed. Completely incorporate the brandy into the egg
  mixture. Place the Advocaat into the top portion of your double boiler.
  Keep your heat on low and slowly, warm the Advocaat. Do not allow the
  mixture to pass the warm point.
  
  NOTES : "This is the Dutch equivalent of eggnog and literally translated
  means "lawyer". This traditional Dutch beverage is always served during the
  Christmas season.  Serve in a lovely glass and provide the guest with a
  small spoon for consumption of the beverage."
