    <directions>
      <step>  Peel the sweet potato. Adjust the fluted blade of a mandoline to 1/4-inch
  and with the mandoline slice the sweet potato, turning it a quarter turn
  after each slice to produce a waffle pattern (If you don't have a
  mandoline, just slice the sweet potato crosswise, about 1/8-inch in
  thickness.) In a deep skillet heat 1-inch of the oil over moderately high
  heat to 375 degrees F. on a deep-fat thermometer, in it fry the slices in
  batches, turning them, for 1 minute, or until they are golden, and transfer
  the chips as they are fried with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain.
  
  The chips may be made 1 day in advance and kept in an airtight container.
  Just before serving arrange the chips in one layer in shallow baking pans
  and heat them in a preheated 400 degrees F. oven for 5 minutes. Sprinkle
  the chips with salt to taste and serve them warm. Makes 2 servings.
