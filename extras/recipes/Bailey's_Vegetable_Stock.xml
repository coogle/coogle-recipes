    <directions>
      <step>  Place oil in a deep pot and add the onion, leek, carrot and fennel. Toss
  and cover tightly, cook over very low heat for about 5 minutes, shaking pan
  occasionally so as not to let vegetables scorch. Add celery, tomato, and
  cabbage. Toss again and cover tightly. Continue to cook over very low heat
  for an additional 10 minutes, shaking pan occasionally. Add water and bay
  leaf. Bring to a simmer and cook, barely simmering, for 30 minutes,
  skimming as necessary. Put ingredients through a strainer which has been
  lined with a double thickness of damp cheese cloth. Allow to cool and
  refrigerate, sealed, or freeze.

  Notes: Makes about 1 quart. ROASTED VARIATION: You may make a
  heartier-flavored stock here by roasting the onion, leek, carrot, fennel,
  and celery, as in the beef stock recipe. When they have browned, add them
  with the dissolved pan juices to the other vegetables which you have
  sweated as in the second part of the Vegetable Stock recipe, then follow
  the balance of the recipe.
