      <step>  Unopened buds are delicious when cooked but must be treated first to remove
  bitterness.  Put them in a pot, pour on boiling water, boil one minute,
  drain, and pour on more boiling water. Repeat this process three times or
  until no bitterness remains when you taste them. Cook them a little longer
  until just tender and serve with butter.
  
  Reader Jean McLain of Peoria, IL wrote "The Herb Companion" and asked: "Any
  ideas what can be done to use milkweed blossoms? The fragrance is musky but
  not unpleasant. Could they be used in moth-repellant bags?" HC responded
  with the above recipe and said they could find no mention of any use of the
  blossoms as a moth repellent.
