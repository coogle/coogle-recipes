      <step>  Recipe by: DDMmom If a fruit jells easily, larger amounts of jelly can be
  made at one time, especially if the jelly maker has experience. When
  there's no one to show you the "sheeting test" to determine if the jell
  point has been reached, there's a much more accurate way. Place candy
  thermometer in boiling water, and note the temperature. For jelly, the
  proper point has been reached when the temp is 8 degrees higher; for
  preserves, it's 9 degrees higher. The easiest and much more economical
  method is to use commercial pectin. It's not as much fun, but in many cases
  it's the only way to get a jell. (Herb jellies unless you use an apple,
  orange, or grape base, will not jell without commercial pectin.) If you use
  sterilized jars and lids, processing isn't too important. However, in the
  deep south with heat and humidity, the keeping qualities are greatly
  improved using this method.  Topping with paraffin makes the use of unique
  jars possible, but it's not a reliable method for me.  It definitely works
  in other areas of the country, and for short term storage I do use it- for
  gift giving with the admonition to use in the near future included on the
  card, for instance. I wish I could recommend a good book- there are bound
  to be many, but mine are so old they're out of print. Call your county
  agent, and look in cartons of canning jars for booklet offers. And the
  library.
