    <directions>
      <step>  Beat egg yolks with the sugar until thick and pale and mixture forms a
  ribbon, as for making a sponge. Melt the chocolate over hot water and
  allow to cool slightly. Fold chocolate very gently into the egg yolk
  mixture, careful not to deflate it too much. Add a Tbls. or two of
  your favourite liqueur if you wish at this point. Whisk the egg
  whites until stiff peaks form. Gently fold into the chocolate mixture.
  
  Pour into a greased and lined 23cm (9 1/2 inch) cake tin or a heart
  shaped tin or other shaped mould...try to keep it simple though as
  this is a moist cake. Bake in a bain marie in the oven at 140C/250F
  for about 1 hour and 15 minutes or until done when tested with a
  toothpick...it will not test completely dry though. Leave to relax
  with the oven door ajar for another hour. The cake will rise like a
  souffle but will settle as there is no flour. Turn out when cold and
  dust with icing (confectioner's) sugar if desired.
  
  Serve with fresh unsweetened heavy cream, berries and a chocolate
  sauce or icecream.
  
  NB: For this cake to turn out well, use a good German, Belgian or
  Swiss bittersweet chocolate (preferably one with at least 60% cocoa
  solids).
  
  Also, I have not given an exact amount of sugar in this recipe...it
  depends on the type of chocolate you use (less sugar if you use
  semisweet chocolate for example) and how sweet you like the cake to
  be. I don't usually measure the sugar but I don't use much as it is
  much nicer if the flavour is intensely chocolate and not overly sweet.
