      <step>  Use loaf pans of anodized aluminum, darkened metal glass for bread with
  well-browned crusts.
  
  Shiny cookie sheets or muffin cups produce sweet rolls u tender, golden
  brown crusts.
  
  Stagger loaf pans on a lower shelf of the oven so they do not touch sides
  of the oven or each other.
  
  The top of each pan should be level with, or slightly above, the middle of
  the oven.
  
  If baking round loaves on a cookie sheet, place the sheet on the center
  rack.
  
  Doneness is determined by tapping the crust. The loaf will have a hollow
  sound when done.
  
  Remove loaves from pans immediately and place on wire racks away from
  draft. to cool.
  
  For a shiny, soft crust, brush just-baked loaf with margarine, butter or
  shortening.
  
  STORING Bread and rolls can be stored in airtight containers in a cool dry
  place for 5 to 7 days. Refrigerate only in hot, humid weather. Breads can
  be stored, tightly wrapped in moistureproof or vaporproof material, labeled
  and dated, in the freezer for 2 to 3 months. To thaw, let stand wrapped at
  room temperature for 2 to 3 hours.
