      <step>  Equipment: One 9-inch square baking pan, preferably non-stick, buttered on
  sides only; one sheet pan, lined with aluminum foil
  
  Place the yeast and warm water in a small bowl and stir with a fork to
  dissolve the yeast. Allow it to stand for about 3 minutes. Mix the flour
  and salt together in a large bowl. Add the warm water and the yeast mixture
  and stir with your fingers to moisten the flour, scraping the sides of the
  bowl and folding the dough over itself until it gathers into a shaggy mass.
  
  Move the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead it by hand for 5
  minutes. This is a soft, moist dough. If the dough seems too stiff and hard
  to knead, add extra warm water 1 tablespoon at a time until you get a nice
  malleable dough. Gently shape the dough into a loose ball, cover it with
  plastic, and let it rest on the table for 20 minutes. (This rest period is
  the autolyse.)
  
  Gently knead the dough on the lightly floured surface for 1to 2 more
  minutes, or until it becomes smooth, supple, and elastic but not too firm.
  The texture of the dough should be soft but springy. Shape the dough into a
  loose ball, place it in a lightly oiled bowl, and turn to coat the top with
  oil. Cover it tightly with plastic wrap and let it rise at room temperature
  (75 to 77 degrees F)until it has doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours
  
  While the dough is rising; in a small saucepan, heat the 9 tablespoons
  butter and the dark brown sugar over low heat, stirring occasionally, until
  the butter has melted and the sugar is completely moistened (it won't be
  dissolved), then whisk until the mixture looks silky and a little lighter
  in color. Use 1 tablespoon softened butter to grease the sides of a 9-inch
  square pan, then pour in the caramel, tilting the pan slightly so the
  mixture spreads evenly over the bottom of the pan. Sprinkle the toasted
  pecans over the warm caramel and press them down slightly. Put the pan in
  the refrigerator to cool the caramel; be the pan's on a level surface. Put
  the granulated sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl and stir until evenly
  mixed. Set aside.
  
  When the dough has doubled, gently pour it out of the bowl onto the floured
  work surface. Flatten the dough and stretch it with your fingers to form a
  13 by 10-inch rectangle, with a long side facing you. Work gently so you
  don't tear the dough surface. The dough should stretch easily at this
  point, but if it resists, let it rest for 5 minutes and resume stretching.
  Check to be sure the dough isn't sticking to the work surface; flour the
  table again, if necessary.
  
  Spread 3 tablespoons of the softened butter evenly over the the dough,
  leaving a 1/2-inch strip unbuttered along the top edge. Sprinkle the
  cinnamon/sugar mixture generously and evenly over the butter, again leaving
  the top 1/2-inch of the rectangle bare. Starting with the bottom edge, roll
  up the dough jelly-roll fashion into a long log. If the dough sticks to the
  table as you're rolling, use a dough scraper to loosen it gently. Pinch
  gently but firmly along the seam to seal it. If necessary, gently shape the
  roll so it is a nice uniform log.
  
  Take the caramel-lined pan out of the refrigerator. Cut the log of dough
  into 9 equal pieces. (It's easiest to mark the roll first to show where
  you're going to make the cuts--a slight indentation with the knife edge
  will do--then use a sharp serrated knife to cut completely through the
  dough.) Lay the pieces cut side down on top of the caramel. Don't worry if
  it's a tight fit. Let rise, uncovered, at room temperature until the dough
  has almost doubled, about 1 to 1 1/4 hours. The rolls should fill the pan
  and extend 1/2 to 3/4-inch above it. In the meantime, position a rack in
  the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Put the pan
  of sticky buns on a foil-lined baking sheet and place it in the oven. Bake
  for 10 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and bake
  for 30 to 40 minutes longer, until the tops of the buns are golden brown
  and crusty. It's important to bake the buns long enough so the dough is
  cooked all the way through and the caramel topping develops properly. Set
  the pan of buns on a rack to cool for 5 minutes. Then quickly but carefully
  turn the pan upsidedown and release the sticky buns onto a large flat
  heatproof plate. Immediately scrape out any caramel remaining and spread it
  on top of the buns, filling in any bare spots. Let them cool until just
  warm before serving. BAKERS DOZEN AMY SCHERBER SHOW #BD1A54 COPYRIGHT 1996
