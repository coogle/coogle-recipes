    <directions>
      <step>  Take the pasta or rice, the meat, and the veggies, and dump them into a 9x9
  baking dish.  Make the sauce by melting the butter in a medium saucepan
  over low heat. If you want to saute the onions or garlic or whatever add-in
  you're using, use one more Tbsp butter. Add the flour and stir until
  completely mixed into a thick paste. Add the milk and slowly bring to a
  boil.  Lower heat and cook just until thick. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
  Remove the sauce from the heat.  Add cheese if making a cheese sauce. Stir
  until melted.  Add desired seasonings to taste. Pour over top of casserole
  mixture and stir gently until mixed well. Bake, uncovered, for 30 minutes.
  Let stand about 10 minutes before serving. This is a great way to use up
  leftovers, and it's different every time you make it because you improvise.
  Very easy, too, and it freezes well as long as you're not using a very hard
  cheese (hard cheeses will separate and the oil will float to the top. Use a
  breadcrumb topping if you've got a craving for Jarlsberg or Gruyere or
  Parmesan.)
