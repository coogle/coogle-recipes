      <step>  Hello, Barbecue Enthusiasts!
  
  Barbecued ribs and chicken demand the perfect side service of bubbling
  baked beans. Today's recipe is a bit of a misnomer, as it is actually
  prepared in your oven a day or two in advance of your cookout, and the
  grill is utilized only to reheat the beans and add a little of that smoky
  essence to your outdoor culinary efforts. Now, you don't have to tell your
  guests that you're serving two-day-old beans -- let them think you've been
  working at the grill since the wee hours of the morning just to prepare the
  perfect barbecue side dish of grilled beans for them tonight.
  
  Remember, cooking secrets should be kept secret! Making it look easy is
  part of the fun.
  
  Rinse and sort the beans, making sure to discard any that are shriveled or
  discolored. Put beans in a large saucepan and cover with water. Bring them
  to a boil over medium heat, then reduce heat to low and simmer, adding more
  water if necessary (up to 2 cups) to keep beans covered. Simmer beans until
  tender, approximately 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Drain beans and reserve the water
  in the saucepan.
  
  Preheat oven to 275-F degrees. In a bean pot or Dutch Oven, layer cooked
  beans, brown sugar, onions, sorghum or molasses, and meat scraps, making
  sure to finish the top layer with beans.
  
  Stir in soy and Worcestershire sauces, dry mustard, salt to taste, and
  Liquid Smoke, if desired. Add reserved bean water and up to one additional
  cup of fresh water to cover the beans.
  
  Bake, uncovered, for 5 to 6 hours, making sure to stir occasionally. If
  beans get too brown, cover loosely with a sheet of aluminum foil. If beans
  dry out, add a little more water and stir from the bottom of the ovenproof
  dish. When they are thoroughly cooked, remove them from the oven and let
  stand to cool. Refrigerate to store.
  
  About 30 to 45 minutes prior to finishing the main course of your barbecue,
  you're going to finish the beans on your prepared moderate- heat grill.
  
  Now, it's best if you have transferred the beans from your good bean pot or
  Dutch Oven to a heavy-bottomed saucepan that you never intend to use again
  for anything but grilled beans (or perhaps an outdoor planter). If you
  don't want to waste a dish just for grilled beans, take a large can (for
  example, an empty tin that held stewed tomatoes) that you have
  painstakingly washed, dried, and saved just for your grilled beans. Spray
  the can with a non-stick cooking spray and place the beans in the can, then
  heat the beans on the grill in it. You'll want to stir from the bottom of
  the can with a wooden spoon to make sure the beans aren't sticking and to
  evenly distribute the heat from the grill.
  
  Serve the beans warm with your main course.
  
  Kitchen Staff Tip: If you're like most cooks and you don't happen to have
  burnt ends from your last pork barbecue in the refrigerator or freezer,
  simply purchase a 1/4-lb portion of smoked ham or a ham slice. Tear or cut
  up the ham and cook it in a skillet over moderate heat with a dab of butter
  or margarine, a tablespoon of brown sugar, and your favorite barbecue
  sauce. Cook it until it's browned and gooey, then cool before using in
  today's recipe. Or, to give it an even more authentic barbecued flavor,
  cook the ham on the grill with your favorite barbecue sauce, then cut or
  tear it into small bite-size portions before proceeding with today's recipe
  as above.
