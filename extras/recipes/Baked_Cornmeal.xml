  "My grandmother was renowned for her baked cornmeal. She was asked to bring
  a roasterful to church dinners and local weddings. Now my mother often does
  the same thing. The secret to light cornmeal is to cook it on the stove,
  then bake it." Serve this cornmeal with roasted meats, cooked vegetables or
  a salad.
  
  In a large saucepan, heat oil over medium-high heat; cook onion, stirring
  occasionally, for 5 minutes or until golden. Reduce heat to medium-low;
  stir in cornmeal until well coated. Stir in milk, salt and sugar; cook,
  stirring constantly, for 15 to 20 minutes or until thickened. combine eggs,
  cream and baking powder. reserving 2 Tbsp for topping, gradually stir in
  egg mixture into cornmeal; cook, stirring for 7 minutes or until very
  thick. Pour into greased 12 cup (3 L) casserole dish. Drizzle reserved egg
  mixture over top; bake, uncovered in 325F oven for 1 hour or until golden.
