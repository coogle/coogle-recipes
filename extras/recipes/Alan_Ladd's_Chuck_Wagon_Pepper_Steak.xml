      <step>  I don't know if this is exactly the Pepper Steak recipe requested earlier
  by I. Chaudhary, but it's one of our favorites. We eat this practically
  year-round and it's good hot or cold.  Makes terrific sandwiches the next
  day.  My mom found this recipe years ago in a magazine - Woman's Day or
  Family Circle, I think - that featured celebrity chefs.  This was from Alan
  Ladd - and I probably just dated myself with that one (I'm really not that
  old!).  For those who don't know who Alan Ladd was, he was a great movie
  star - best movie was "Shane" - at least a three hanky.  Anyway, here's the
  recipe.
  
  Sprinkle meat with tenderizer, pierce with a fork (make lots of pierces so
  the marinade soaks thru), and place in baking dish.  Mix rest of
  ingredients, except peppercorns, in a bowl and pour over meat.  Lift meat
  up so marinade gets under it and can soak through. Marinate overnight (I
  usually start this in the evening and let it marinate overnight and all the
  next day) in refrigerator, turning frequently.  When ready to grill or
  broil, remove meat from marinade and pound half the peppercorns into each
  side.  Broil to desired doneness.  Slice meat thinly and on the diagonal
  and serve.
  
  We always cook this on our grill outside.  It has a wonderful taste - very
  peppery and if you like it spicier, add more peppercorns.  I've given up
  measuring them.  Hint:  I take whole peppercorns, put them in a zippered
  heavy-duty plastic bag, and pound them with my meat mallet.  We've also
  tried different red wines for the marinade - burgandy, sangria, etc.  And
  get a bottle large enough to enjoy some while you're grilling!
