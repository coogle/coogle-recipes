      <step>  The flavor of anise in these light cookies makes them a great after- dinner
  dessert. Some people prefer the center to be soft and chewy, but if you
  prefer the dry melt-in-your-mouth type of meringue, turn off the oven and,
  with the door closed, let them stand 30 minutes to an hour. These cookies
  are generally baked on parchment paper, but we have found that regular bond
  paper makes a very acceptable substitute. (By Times Food Stylists) Beat egg
  whites until frothy. Add cream of tartar and beat to soft peaks. Gradually
  beat in sugar. Continue beating until stiff and glossy. Beat in anise.
  Using pastry bag, pipe onto parchment-lined baking sheets. Bake at 275
  degrees F. 30 minutes. Makes about 4 dozen kisses. NOTE: If drier meringue
  is desired, turn off oven and let kisses stand in oven with door closed
  about 1 hour. Each kiss contains about: 9 calories; 4 mg sodium; 0
  cholesterol; 0 fat; 2 grams carbohydrates; 0 protein; trace fiber.
