  Around 1977, I was fortunate to take a class at the Los Feliz Jewish
  Community Center (Los Angeles) with Judy Zeidler, before she became the
  author of several great books on Jewish cooking. She was then a columnist
  with the Los Angeles Times.
  
  She proved how much she enjoyed cooks and cooking -- her sense of fun was
  so infectious, and we all laughed so hard, that I came home covered with
  flour, tahine, and apricot-pineapple preserves!
  
  I now serve her tasty Apple &amp; Spinach Salad to my family:
  
  In a large bowl: Toss apples, onions and celery.  Sprinkle with juice of
  one lemon to keep apples from darkening.
  
  In a blender or small bowl: Blend mayonnaise, tahini, honey and remaining
  lemon juice (misture will be thick).  Toss with apple mixture.  Cover and
  chill.
  
  Just before serving, toss salad with spinach.  Serve on a bed of spinach
  leaves and garnish with sesame seeds.  Serves 4 to 6.
