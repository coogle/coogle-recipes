      <step>  PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Spread almonds on a baking sheet and toast them in
  oven until lightly golden. Let cool. Coarsely chop half the nuts. Butter 2
  large baking sheets. Mix flour, sugar, salt and baking soda. Beat in eggs,
  then whole and chopped nuts. Mix to obtain a firm dough. Knead briefly,
  then divide dough into 4 pieces. On a floured work surface, roll each piece
  under your hands into a cylinder 15 inches long and about 1 1/2 inches in
  diameter. Place 2 rolls, well separated, on each baking sheet and bake 15
  to 20 minutes, until very lightly browned and firm to the touch. With a
  spatula, carefully transfer the rolls to a cutting board and slice each one
  diagonally into cookies about 1/2-inch thick. Set wire racks on the baking
  sheets and lay out the biscotti on them. Return them to the oven for 20 to
  30 minutes, or until very firm and crisp. Cool on the racks, then transfer
  them to a tin for long keeping.
  
  Try adding 1 1/2-to-2 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder to this
  recipe for a nice variation.
