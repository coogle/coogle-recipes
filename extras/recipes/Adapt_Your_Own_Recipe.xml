      <step>  REDUCE CHOLESTEROL ~ Use vegetable oil or margarine instead of butter
  ~ Substitute 2 egg whites for 1 egg, or use egg substitute ~ Use more
  vegetables and grains and less meat in recipe ~ Use soy-based product
  to replace part of meat eg. tofu ~ Use nonfat milk products instead
  of whole milk
  
  REDUCE FAT CONTENT ~ Use reduced calorie mayonnaise and salad
  dressing ~ Blend cottage cheese or yogurt with milk for sour cream
  topping ~ Replace regular whipping cream with low-cal topping or
  yogurt ~ Remove visible fat from meat and skin from poultry before
  cooking ~ Decrease oil in marinades and salad dressing; increase
  vinegar, water and seasonings ~ Use foods canned in their own juice
  or water ~ De-fat meat drippings by refrigerating and skimming fat
  off the top ~ Decrease the amount of fat used in baked goods by 1/3
  to 1/2 and increase fluids called for to reach desired consistency. ~
  Cheese that is finely grated or thinly sliced goes further ~ Pour
  some of the fat off the top of "natural" peanut butters
  
  REDUCE SODIUM CONTENT ~ Use low-salt or no-salt-added products ~
  Increase your use of herbs and spices in place of salt in recipes ~
  Use fresh foods whenever possible in place of canned or processed
  (soup mixes, cured meats etc) or rinse canned foods (tuna) with water
  ~ Do not add salt to water when cooking pasta or other foods
  
  REDUCE SUGAR CONTENT ~ Decrease the amount of sugar called for in
  traditional recipes by at least 1/3; substitute fruit juices, nectars
  or pureed fruits. ~ Use fruit canned in water or fruit juice ~ Use
  non caloric sweeteners if needed to increase the sweetness of a
  recipe without added calories.  (Most baked desserts require at least
  3/4 tsp. sugar per serving to achieve a desirable flavor.)
