      <step>  from the peel, then carefully slide them onto the baking stone. Place the
  pan of bread on the rack below the stone. Using a plant sprayer, quickly
  mist the loaves with water 8 to 10 times, then quickly shut oven door. Mist
  the loaves again after 1 minute. Then mist again 1 minute later.
  
  Bake for about 10 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 450 degrees and
  bake 15 minutes longer or until the loaves sound slightly hollow when
  tapped on the bottom and the crust is a medium to dark brown. (If the crust
  is not brown enough, the loaves will soften as they cool.) Transfer the
  bread to a rack to cool for at least 30 minutes before serving.
