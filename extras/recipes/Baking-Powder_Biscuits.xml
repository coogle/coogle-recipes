      <step>  From the 8 Week Cholesterol Cure Cookbook. Tastes best right out of the
  oven.
  
  Preheat oven to 450 degrees. In a mixing bowl, stir together flour, baking
  powder, rice bran, apple fiber, and salt. Or you could do this in a food
  processor.  Add milk all at once and stir until ingredients are just
  combined; if you are doing this in a food processor, pulse the machine a
  few times just until dough is combined. If the dough seems a little dry,
  sprinkle on a tablespoon of water and work it in.
  
  With lightly floured hands, knead the dough for 30 seconds.  Then pat and
  push it out until it is 1/2 inch thick.  With a 1 1/2 inch biscuit cutter,
  cut the dough into about 18 rounds.  Set rounds on an ungreased baking
  sheet.  Bake for 16 minutes or until cooked through.
  
  VARIATIONS:  To make herbed bisuits, add 1 tsp dried herbs of your choice
  to the dry ingredients, before adding the milk.
  
  To make buttermilk bisbuits, use 1% fat buttermilk instead of the
  evaporated milk and substitute 2 tsp baking powder, mixed with 1/2 tsp
  baking soda, for the baking powder.
  
  To make oat-bran biscuits, substitute 1 cup oat bran for the rice bran and
  apple fiber.
