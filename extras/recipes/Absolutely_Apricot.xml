      <step>  If your machine offers the option, use the "light crust" setting as the
  crust browns more due to the sugar content of the jam. Try to use a jam
  with a high fruit content &amp; few additives. This recipe can be baked on the
  regular, rapid bake, or timed settings. I have a DAK Turbo II &amp; baked it on
  the reg setting.  It was one of the few loaves that have turned out really
  well lately...think my DAK is dying; just today ordered a ZOJI from Irwin.
  The bread kept VERY well in a Rubbermaid container...was nice &amp; fresh for a
  whole week (I forgot about the last couple of slices!). I even made it when
  MY mother-in-law came to visit &amp; she LOVED it! Hope it turns out good for
  you.
