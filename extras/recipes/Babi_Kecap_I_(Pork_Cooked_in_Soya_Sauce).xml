    <directions>
      <step>  particular favourite with my own husband and children, who always
  know when it is about to appear on the table because the ginger and
  garlic frying in the sauce smell so deliciously savoury.
  
  Cut the pork into small cubes.  Put the flour into a bowl and add the
  clear soya sauce and ginger powder, mixing them well together.  Coat
  the pork with the mixture and then let it stand for at least 30
  minutes.
  
  Clean and slice the mushrooms.  Peel the garlic and ginger and slice
  them very thin; you can use these thin slices as they are, or cut
  them again into very tiny sticks.
  
  Heat the oil or fat in a wok or thick frying pan and fry the meat,
  half of it at a time, turning it from time to time, for 5 minutes.
  
  Repeat the process for the remaining half of the meat.  The flour that
  coated the meat will tend to stay in the pan or stick to the bottom
  of it, but leave it there-it will thicken the sauce later.  Now take
  most of the oil out of the pan, leaving only about two tablespoons
  which you then heat again.  In this, fry the tiny slices of garlic
  and ginger and the mushrooms, stirring continuously, for i minute.
  Add the soya sauce, the water and the meat. mix well, season with
  pepper or chilli powder, and stir continuously for 1 or 2 minutes.
  just before serving, add the sherry or rice wine and the lemon juice.
  Serve hot.
  
  This dish keeps extremely well in the freezer, and it is worth making
  a large quantity from, say, half a leg-of pork, which is much cheaper
  than buying pork fillet.  If you are going to freeze your Babi Kecap,
  however, do not add the sherry or lemon juice at the time of cooking.
  To serve from the freezer, thaw the meat out completely and heat
  quickly on a high flame for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring or shaking the
  pan well all the time. Add the sherry or rice wine and lemon juice
  just before serving.
  
  Makes 4 servings.
