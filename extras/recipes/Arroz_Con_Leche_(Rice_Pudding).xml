    <directions>
      <step>  Bring 2 quarts water to a boil in a medium saucepan.  Remove from heat, and
  add rice.  Let stand for 20 minutes.  Rinse rice well, and drain.  Bring 3
  quarts water to a boil in another saucepan, and add rice.  Boil uncovered
  for 30 minutes or until rice is tender.(Some rice will take considerable
  less time.) Be careful not to overcool. Drain off excess water. Mix scalded
  and evaporated milk, sugar, and cinnamon in a medium saucepan. Cook for 45
  minutes or until mixture begins to thicken and changes color. Add rice and
  raisins.  Cook for 40 minutes or until pudding thickens. Remove from heat,
  and stir occasionally until pudding cools thoroughly. To serve, spoon rice
  pudding onto a platter, and sprinkle with cinnamon. The pudding can be
  cooked until it is very thick,if desired.  It also can be shaped into
  patties and dipped in beaten eggs and rolled inbread crumbs before frying
  in oil and butter until light brown.  The patties are rolled in cinnamon
  and sugar before serving. Chanteclair's note - my long grain rice would be
  mush if cooked that long, and it isn't converted. I would suggest that if
  you just cooked rice the way you normally do (but more al dente). The long
  cooking process is to partially caramelize the sugar in the pudding. I
  suggest you lightly caramelize the sugar before you start - or maybe cheat
  and use brown sugar. I have had this recipe - prepared the tradtional way -
  and it was delicious. Something different
