      <step>  *  Fresh Oregano also may be used.
  
  Place whole heads of garlic, prepared as for Roasted Garlic, on a sheet of
  heavy-duty foil.
  Top with butter (4 T per 8 Heads) and a few sprigs of fresh rosemary or
  oregano.  If fresh herbs are unavailable, substitute dried (2 t of dried
  herbs for 8 heads of garlic).  Fold the foil over the garlic and seal the
  package well.
  Cook over hot coals for about 45 minutes, turning the package occasionally
  with tongs.
