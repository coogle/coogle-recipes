      <step>  The delicious crumb topping makes these muffins taste like miniature coffee
  cakes. Good at tea time and also for brunch. Cool at least 1 hour before
  serving.
  
  Topping
  
  1/2 cup chopped walnuts 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons granulated
  sugar 2 tablespoons butter, at room temperature 1/4 teaspoon ground
  cinnamon
  
  Batter
  
  1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 cup granulated sugar 2 teaspoons baking
  powder 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon
  salt 2 large eggs 1 cup sour cream 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter, melted 1 cup
  diced unpeeled apple, preferably a tart apple such as Granny Smith or
  Greenings
  
  Heat oven to 375 F. Grease muffin cups or use foil baking cups.
  
  Put streusel topping ingredients into a medium-size bowl. Mix with a fork,
  then crumble with fingers until mixture looks like chopped walnuts.
  
  To make the muffin batter, thoroughly mix fllour, sugar, baking powder,
  cinnamon, allspice, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.
  
  Break eggs into another bowl. Add sour cream and melted butter, and whisk
  until well blended. Stir in diced apple.
  
  Pour egg mixture over flour mixture and fold in just until dry ingredients
  are moistened.
  
  Scoop batter into muffin cups. Top each muffin with about 2 teaspoons of
  the streusel topping.
  
  Bake 20 to 25 minutes, or until browned. A toothpick inserted into the
  center should come out clean. Remove from pans and let cool at least 1 hour
  before serving.
