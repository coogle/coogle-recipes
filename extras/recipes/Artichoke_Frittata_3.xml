    <directions>
      <step>  Preheat a broiler. Have ready a large ceramic bowl (do not use metal)
  filled with cold water to which you have added the lemon juice or vinegar.
  Trim only a thin slice from the bottom of the stem of each artichoke to
  remove the dark skin. Pare off all the green skin. The flesh of the stem is
  good. With your hand, pull off the tough outer leaves until you reach
  leaves that have tender, white areas at their base. (cut off only the upper
  part of the inner leaves that are dark green at the top and light greenish
  yellow at the base.) The inner rows of leaves are the tender part you want,
  so be careful not to cut away too much. Cut the artichoke in half
  lengthwise and, with a small knife, cut out the hairy choke and any other
  tough inner purple leaves. Immediately put the cleaned artichokes into the
  acidulated water to prevent them from turning brown. When all of the
  artichokes have been turned, drain them.
  
  Place each artichoke half cut side down on a surface and cut lengthwise
  into 1 /4-inch-thick slices.
  
  Bring a large saucepan filled with water to a boil. Add the artichokes and
  3/4 teaspoon of the salt and boil until tender but not mushy. Fresh, young
  artichokes will be ready in approximately 5 minutes; old, tough artichokes
  may take up to 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and allow to cool. In a small
  skillet over medium heat, warm 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Add the
  onion and saute until golden, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and let
  cool slightly. Meanwhile, in a bowl, beat the eggs lightly with a fork.
  Beat in the remaining Parmigiano with the oil, lemon juice, garlic, and
  pepper to taste. Drizzle over the fish. Sprinkle with the parsley. Serve at
  room temperature.
