      <step>  Make the milk chocolate layer: Line an 8 inche square pan with plastic wrap
  leaving an overhang. In a metal bowl, set over a pan of barely simmering
  water, melt chocolate and whisk until smooth. In another bowl with an
  electric mixer beat peanut butter with Baileys until smooth. Add the
  chocolate and the cookies and mix until blended well. Pour into the
  prepared pan, smoothing the top with a spatula. Cover with plastic wrap and
  chill about two hours or until firm.
  
  Make the bittersweet layer: In a metal bowl set over a pan of barely
  simmering water melt the chocolate and whisk until smooth. Cool until
  tepid. In a bowl with an electric mixer, whip cream to soft peaks. Gently
  fold half of the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture and then fold in
  the remainder. Pour mixture over the firm chilled milk chocolate layer.
  Spread with a spatula until smooth and bang on work surface to eliminate
  air bubbles. Cover with plastic wrap and chill for 4 to 6 hours or until
  firm. (This can be prepared several days ahead.)
  
  To serve: Remove from refrigerator at least one hour before serving. Lift
  dessert out of the pan. Cut lengthwise into 1-inch strips using a knife
  dipped in hot water and dried. Then cut each strip in half crosswise to
  form two 4 x 1 inch bars. Sieve cocoa powder over the top of the bars.
  Place 2 bars on 8 plates, resting 1 edge of 1 bar on top of the second bar.
  Let sit at room temperature about 1 hour before serving.
