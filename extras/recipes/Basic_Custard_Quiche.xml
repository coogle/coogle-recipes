      <step>  Recipe by: Inn recipes *1 recipe Piret's Quiche Pastry or Vienna Pastry. 1.
  Line the quiche pan with the pastry, pinch up a rim, and prick the bottom
  all over with a fork. Partially bake the pastry, if you wish, and set it
  aside. 2. To make the filling: Whisk together the eggs, flour, nutmeg,
  salt, and white pepper. Blend in the cream, and then the milk. 3. Evenly
  distribute whatever cheese, meat, and/or vegetables you are using in the
  prepared shell, and pour in the custard filling. (if you are using
  high-moisture vegetables, such as tomatoes, zucchini, or mushrooms, they
  should be cooked first to evaporate some of their water content.). 4.
  Preheat oven to 375. Place the filled pan on a baking sheet. Generally,
  custard quiches should be baked for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the custard
  is just set. Let the quiche rest for 8 to 10 minutes before slicing and
  serving it. Make one 9 to 11-inch or four 4-inch tarts. This is the basic
  custard mixture that goes into many of our quiches. Some of our favorite
  combinations appear below, but we hope you'll use them as inspiration for
  your own creations. Just about any combination of grated cheese,
  vegetables, leftover meat, poultry, or seafood, or whatever else appeals to
  you can be added to this all-purpose custard.JM. Mary Prentiss Inn
