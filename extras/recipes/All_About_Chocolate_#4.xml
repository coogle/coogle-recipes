        <title>HOW TO MELT CHOCOLATE</title></ing-div></ingredients>
    <directions>
      <step>    Always melt chocolate with gentle heat because it scorches easily. If
  chocolate is to be melted alone, make certain that the container and
  utensils are absolutely dry; a tiny drop of moisture will cause the
  chocolate to become lumpy and stiff.  If this should happen, stir in one
  teaspoon of vegetable shortening for each ounce of chocolate. Remember that
  unsweetened chocolate liquifies when melted, but semisweet and baking
  chocolate will hold their shapes until stirred. For faster melting, cut or
  chop chocolate into smaller pieces. To melt chocolate, place it in a heavy
  saucepan over low heat and stir until melted. Or, place chocolate in top of
  a double boiler and melt over hot water, stirring until smooth.
    To melt chocolate in a microwave oven, place a 1-ounce square in a 1-cup
  glass measure.  Microwave, uncovered, at MEDIUM (50% power) for 1 to 2
  minutes or until chocolate is almost melted. Stir until completely melted
  and smooth.  Add 10 seconds for each additional ounce of chocolate. To melt
  chocolate morsels in a microwave oven, place 1 cup chocolate morsels in a
  2-cup measure.  Microwave, uncovered, at MEDIUM (50% power) for 2 to 4
  minutes or until morsels are glossy. Stir until smooth. Formatted by Rose
