      <step>  :
  
  1.  SPRINKLE YEAST OVER WATER IN MIXER BOWL.  DON NOT USE TEMPERATURES
  ABOVE
  110F.  MIX WELL.  LET STAND 5 MINUTES; STIR.
  
  2.  USING A WIRE SHIP, ADD SUGAR AND SALT TO YEAST SOLUTION; STIR UNTIL
  INGREDIENTS ARE DISSOLVED.
  
  3.  USING A DOUGHHOOK, ADD FLOUR; MIX AT LOW SPEED 1 MINUTE OR UNTIL ALL
  FLOUR IS INCORPORATED INTO LIQUID.  CONTINUE MIXING AT MEDIUM SPEED 13-15
  MINUTES UNTIL DOUGH IS SMOOTH AND ELASTIC.  (DOUGH WILL BE VERY STIFF).
  DOUGH TEMPERATURE SHOULD BE 78-82 F.
  
  4.  COVER; LET REST 15 MINUTES.
  
  5.  PLACE DOUGH ON UNFLOURED WORK SURFACE; DIVIDE DOUGH INTO 3 OZ PIECES;
  KNEAD BRIEFLY; SHAPE INTO BALLS BY ROLLING IN CIRCULAR MOTION ON WORK
  SURFACE.
  
  6.  PLACE BALLS, IN ROWS 4 BY 6, ON 4 UNGREASED SHEET PANS.
  
  7.  FERMENT:  SET IN WARM PLACE (80F.) ABOUT 15-20 MINUTES OR UNTIL DOUGH
  INCREASES SLIGHTLY IN BULK.
  
  8.  MAKE-UP:  SHAPE BAGELS LIKE A DOUGHNUT; FLATTEN TO 1/2" CIRCLES, 3/4"
  THICK.  PINCH CENTER OF EACH BAGEL WTIH THUMB AND FOREFINGER AND PULL
  GENTLY
  TO MAKE A 1" DIAMETER HOLE AND A TOTAL 3 1/2" DIAMETER, KEEPING UNIFORM
  SHAPE.  PLACE ON 4 UNGREASED SHEET PANS IN ROWS 4 BY 6 PER PAN.
  
  9.  PROOF:  AT 90F. UNTIL BAGELS BEGIN TO RISE, ABOUT 20-30 MINUTES.
  
  10.  LIGHTLY GREASE 5 SHEET PANS; USE 13 1/3 OZ (2 1/2 CUPS) CORN MEAL.
  SPRINKLE EACH PAN WITH 1/2 CUP CORNMEAL.
  
  11.  ADD 4 GAL WATER TO STEAM JACKETED KETTLE OR STOCK POT; BRING TO A
  BOIL;
  REDUCE HEAT TO A SIMMER.  ADD 3 1/2 OZ (1/2 CUP) GRANULATED SUGAR TO WATER.
  STIR UNTIL DISSOLVED.  GENTLY DROP BAGELS ONE AT AT TIME, INTO WATER.  COOK
  30 SECONDS; TURN; COOK 30 SECONDS.  REMOVE BAGELS WITH SLOTTED SPOON;
  DRAIN.
  PLACE ON SHEET PANS IN ROWS 4 BY 5.
  
  12.  BAKE:  30-35 MINUTES OR UNTIL GOLDEN BROWN AND CRISP.  REMOVE FROM
  PAN;
  COOL ON WIRE RACKS.
  
  NOTE:  1.  IN STEP 1, A 60 QT MIXER SHOULD BE USED FOR 100 PORTIONS AS
  DOUGH
  IS VERY STIFF.  IF USING 20-30 QT MIXERS, PREPARE NO MORE THAN 50 PORTIONS
  AT A TIME.
  
  2.  IN STEP 7 AND 9, BAGELS SHOULD NOT DOUBLE IN BULK.
  
  3.  IN STEP 12, IF CONVECTION OVEN IS USED, BAKE AT 350F., 15-20
  MINUTES ON HIGH FAN, OPEN VENT.
