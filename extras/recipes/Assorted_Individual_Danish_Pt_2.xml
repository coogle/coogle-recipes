      <step>  Yield: 3/4 cups
  
  Cheese Filling: Blend the sugar with the softened cream cheese until
  thoroughly combined. Don't overbeat or aerate. Mix in the yolk. Chill until
  firm.
  
  Yield: 2 cups
  
  Cinnamon Sugar: Mix to combine. You can use any spice or combination of
  spices.
  
  Yield: 1 cup
  
  Apricot Glaze: Place the apricot jam and water in a small saucepan and warm
  over medium high heat until it dissolves. Just before boiling, remove from
  heat. Dilute with a little more water if necessary until it is thin enough
  to brush evenly. Apply immediately with a soft, flat pastry brush.
  
  Sugar Icing: Whisk a very small amount of milk into the sugar until all the
  lumps are gone. Continue to add milk, a few drops at a time, until it
  ribbons off the whisk. Drizzle it over the warm pastry using your
  fingertips, a fork, or the whisk.
  
  Yield: 1/2 cup
  
  Remonce: Cream the butter, sugar (and cinnamon, if added). Keep
  refrigerated. Let soften at room temperature to spreadable consistency
  before using.
  
  Yield: about 1/2 cup
