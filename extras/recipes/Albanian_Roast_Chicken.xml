  Here's another recipe which is a great favorite of ours, and which I
  clipped from a newspaper (Washington Post?) about 15 years ago. It's called
  "Albanian Chicken", although I've never seen an Albanian Cookbook, and have
  never seen another Albanian recipe, it seems like something my great
  grandmother would have cooked. The use of sauerkraut as a stuffing seems
  weird, but is characteristic of Middle European cooking. You often find it
  mixed with apples...here it's mixed with paprika and caraway seeds. The
  stuffing is sensationally delicious, and the chicken comes out extremely
  tender, every time. This is a recipe you have to cook to understand.
  
  Saute onion in oil until golden, stirring often. Combine sauerkraut,
  paprika, and caraway seeds with onion. Spoon as much kraut mixture as
  possible into the body cavity of the chicken. Reserve remainder of kraut
  for later
  
  Place chicken on roasting rack in a shallow roasting pan. Bake at 325
  degrees for 1-1/2 hours. Remove pan from oven, take chicken out. Pour off
  fat in bottom of pan. Spread remaining kraut in bottom of pan and set
  chicken in pan. Bake another 1/2 to 1 hour to brown. Season as desired.
  
  Leftovers make great sliced chicken and sauerkraut sandwiches.
  
  (If your mail program renders the times weird looking, they're 1.5 hurs for
  baking, and .5 to 1 hour for browning.  The "=BD" is ASCII 189 and=
  represents "1/2" in US English.)
