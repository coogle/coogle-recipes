    <directions>
      <step>  1. Drain the pasta and transfer to a large baking dish. Toss with 1
  tablespoon of the butter. 2. Heat the remaining butter in a skillet and
  saut√© the onion until slightly softened, about 2 minutes. 3. Mix the onion,
  pepper, and Cheese Sauce with the penne. Sprinkle with bread crumbs and
  bake in a pre-heated 4250 oven for 15 minutes until the bread crumbs are
  lightly toasted. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
  
  MAKE IT LIGHT: Reduce butter to 2 teaspoons and substitute the Light
  Version Cheese Sauce.
  
  MAKE IT AHEAD: Prepare the recipe. Unbaked, the penne can be stored up to 1
  day in the refrigerator or 1 month in the freezer. If frozen, extend baking
  time by 25 minutes.
  
  SERVING SUGGESTION: Serve this as a main dish with a green salad for a
  light menu. For heartier fare, serve as a first course, followed by grilled
  chicken, meat, or fish.
