  Baileys Yellow Cake: (Favorite One-Egg Cake recipe from McCalls cookbook,
  with Baileys substituted for some of the liquid)
  
  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Grease and flour a 13 x 9 x 2
  inch baking pan, and a 6 x 9 x 2 inch pan, or whatever combination of pans
  that will hold 1 1/2 times the amount that a 13 x 9 x 2 pan holds.
  
  2. Mix the flour with the salt and baking powder. Mix the Baileys with the
  milk.
  
  3. Using electric mixer, cream the shortening with the sugar. Add the egg
  and vanilla, and beat well. Add the flour mixture, alternately with the
  Baileys and milk mixture. Beat for 2 minutes.
  
  4. Pour half of the cake batter into the prepared pans, then drop large
  spoonfuls of the Baileys Swirl (recipe below) into the pans alternately
  with large spoonfuls of the cake batter. Swirl with knife or fork to get a
  marbled effect.
  
  5. Bake about 25-35 minutes, or until surface springs back when lightly
  pressed with fingertip.
  
  6. Let cool, then spread with Baileys glaze (recipe below).
  
  Note: actually the cookbook called for the shortening and milk to be added
  together to the flour, but that didn't make any sense to me, so I changed
  it to the method I'm familiar with, where the shortening and sugar are
  creamed together first. I used butter for the shortening, since that was
  all I had available. I guess you could use margarine or a solid vegetable
  fat like Crisco.
  
  Baileys Swirl (Cream Cheese Frosting recipe in McCalls cookbook, with
  Baileys and white chocolate added):
  
  1. With electric mixer, beat cheese with butter and vanilla until creamy
  
  2. Add the confectioners sugar; beat until light and fluffy.
  
  3. Stir in the Baileys and white chocolate, and mix well.
  
  Baileys glaze: Mix 3/4 cup Baileys with 1 cup of the powdered sugar. Add
  more Baileys if the glaze is too thick; add more sugar if the glaze is too
  thin. Add more Baileys and sugar if there isn't enough glaze.
  
  Sorry to be so imprecise, but I didn't really keep track of the amounts
  while I was doing this, since I had to leave in 15 minutes with the cake!
  
  The really fun thing was trying to explain to people what was in the cake!
  The non-Americans didn't understand the concept of cream cheese frosting at
  all. It was really hard to explain what frosting is, and I realized this is
  because over here, either a cake is dusted with powdered sugar (i.e. carrot
  cake is dusted with powdered sugar here), or it is topped with a thin
  glaze, or it is "frosted" but with whipped cream or a recipe containing
  mostly whipped cream.
  
  Many of them had never drunk Baileys (which is readily available in
  supermarkets here)! One woman was positive there was marzipan in the cake!
  But it was a hit anyway; I had no leftovers to take home! Good thing I
  still had the smaller cake at home!
