    <directions>
      <step>  *cut in small thin slices.
  
  Note: the empanadas may be sauted or baked. If you are going to bake them,
  preheat oven to 375F and butter a cookie sheet.
  
  1)Combine flour and salt in a medium-sized bowl. Make a well in the center.
  2)Pour in the water and stir until reasonably well combined. Then turn out
  on a floured surface and knead until smooth (5 minutes). 3)Divide the dough
  into 8 equal parts, and knead each one into a small ball. Set the balls
  aside. 4)Peel the banana and cut it laterally into quarters. Cut each
  quarter in half lengthwise. 5)Roll out each ball of dough into a circle
  approximately 5 inches in diameter. Place a couple of small cheese slices
  near the center, and cut a 1/8-inch piece of the banana into several small
  strips on top of the cheese. Lightly brush the edges of the dough with
  water, and fold the dough over the filling, as you would a turnover. Crimp
  the edges securely with a fork. Set the finished empanada aside and repeat
  until you have 8. 6)To Saute: for every four empanadas melt 1 TB butter in
  heavy skillet and saute over medium heat for about 5 minutes on each side..
  
  To Bake: arrange the empanadas on the buttered cookie sheet, making
  absolutely sure they are securely closed. (If cheese creeps out during
  baking, it will burn.) Brush the tops lightly with melted butter, and bake
  at 375F for 12 to 15 minutes.
  
  Serve hot.
