      <step>      1/2 lb lean ground beef
        1 md yellow onion, chopped
       15 oz can peeled tomatoes
  :          or
        3 md fresh peeled plus
      1/2 c  water
      1/2 md bell pepper
  :          (any color), chopped
      1/2 c  sliced mushrooms
  :          (canned is fine)
        3    stalks celery, sliced
        2 cl garlic, minced
        1 ts garlic powder
        1 ts oregano
        1 ts basil
        1 ts rosemary
      1/2 ts thyme
        1    dollop good olive oil
  :          X-tra Hot Sauce to taste
  :          fresh ground black pepper
  :          grated Parmesan
  :          or
  :          Romano cheese
  
  Brown the ground beef with the onions in a medium to large skillet (it
  should have a lid; alternatively, a large covered saucepan may be
  used). Drain the fat.  Chop the tomatoes into bite-size pieces (do
  not drain) and add to the beef.  Add the mushrooms, celery, pepper
  and garlic. Add herbs, crushing first, making sure the rosemary
  needles are well broken-up. Add a dollop (just enough for flavor) of
  olive oil, grind some pepper on top to taste.  Finally, add the hot
  sauce to taste, remembering that the sauce simmers down and it will
  concentrate the hot stuff! Cook on medium heat for 5-10 minutes
  uncovered, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes.
  Uncover, and reduce sauce until it is the desired consistency. Serve
  over pasta with grated cheese and crusty bread. Heather Pierce Walt MM
