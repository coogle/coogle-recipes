    <directions>
      <step>  Directions: Place ribs in a baking dish, bowl or heavy duty plastic bag.
  Combine other ingredients and pour over ribs. Toss ribs so all are evenly
  coated. Refrigerate for at least 8 hours or overnight. Remove ribs from the
  sauce and place on smoker grid.  Baste with sauce before cooking and once
  during cooking. * This sauce can be used on bone-in ribs, just increase
  cooking time. CHARCOAL:  Use 5-7 lbs. charcoal, 3 quarts hot water, 2 wood
  sticks and smoke 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours. ELECTRIC: Use 2 1/2 quarts hot
  water, 2 wood sticks and smoke 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours. GAS: Use 3 quarts hot
  water, 2 wood sticks and smoke 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours. Formatted for
