      <step>  Sift flour with salt. Slowly add water. Mix well. Make a stiff dough. Cover
  with a damp cloth for 20 minutes. Boil potatoes, peel and mash. Add salt,
  onion, pepper and coriander. Mix well. Divide into 8 portions. Knead dough
  well until smooth and pliable. Divide into 6 round balls. Flatten each ball
  slightly. Put one portion of filling in centre. Close up completely. Shape
  into round balls again. Roll out each ball on a lightly floured board into
  a round disk 6" (15 cm) diameter. Cook one at a time on a hot griddle over
  medium heat. Put about 1 or 2 tbsp ghee around the edge. Turn gently. Cook
  until sides turn golden brown in colour. Serve with yogurt. Vegetarian
  Kheema Roti: Instead of potato stuffing, used cooked and seasoned
  vegetarian minced meat (Anne's note: the preface lists "nutri nuggets"; I
  suspect that this is an Indian brand of TVP) for stuffing.
