      <step>  Cook up lots of chopped  onions and some hamburger meat (the amount
  depended upon how flush the pocket book was at the time). Of course, my
  mother used to use a little bacon fat in the pan to begin with, and drain
  off any extra fat from the hamburger, tho we raised our own meat, and it
  was pasture fed, pretty lean.  Meanwhile get a BIG pot of water boiling and
  cook up a mess of elbow macaroni - depending on how much you need to
  stretch the recipe.  We always used "the macaroni kettle", and woe if
  something else was in it.   Remember - I made this for 14 people, and I
  still always make too much.  And we are not talking pasta here, we need
  plain old Prince elbow macaroni.  Here is where my  family added their own
  touch.  Rather than Campbell's tomato soup, we used our own home grown
  canned tomatoes. My mother used to can about 200 quarts a season. So dump a
  quart or so of good thick canned tomatoes (break up the whole tomatoes a
  bit)  in with the hamburger and onions, add the macaroni, and salt and
  pepper to taste.  Serve up in big bowls with homemade bread.  We came to
  like it best made this way.   If you use the Campbells' tomato soup
  variation, just add enough soup to make the mixture nice and gooey. Some
  people, being fancier than we were, would put the whole mixture in a big
  casserole dish, top it with buttered bread crumbs and bake it for a short
  time in the oven.  This used to appear at Pot-Luck Suppers with great
  regularity. Could feed a lot of hungry kiddos with American Chop Suey
