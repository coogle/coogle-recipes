      <step>  From "375 Great Cookies &amp; Brownies," by Joanne Lamb Hayes and Bonnie
  Tandy Leblang (HarperCollins, 1993, $16.95).
  
  In medium bowl, beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer on medium
  speed until well blended. Beat in egg and almond extract until light
  and fluffy.
  
  Mix together flour, baking powder, salt and add, beat on low speed
  until dough is smooth, scraping down sides of bowl frequently with a
  rubber spatula. Wrap dough and refrigerate 2-3 hours, until firm.
  
  Meanwhile, finely chop dried apricots. In a small bowl stir together
  apricots and honey. Set apricot filling aside at room temperature
  until dough has chilled.
  
  Heat oven to 350'F. Between pieces of waxed paper, roll out dough 1/8"
  thick. Cut out cookies with 2" round cutter. Reroll scraps to make
  additional cookies.
  
  Place half of cookies 2" apart on lightly greased cookie sheets. Spoon
  about 1/2 teaspoon apricot filling into center of cookies. Moisten
  edges of cookies with water and top with remaining cookies to make a
  sandwich. Press edges together with fingertips to seal. Pierce center
  of each "pillow" with tines of fork.
  
  Bake 10-12 minutes, or until edges are golden brown. Let cookies cool
  2 minutes on sheets, then remove to racks and cool completely. Store
  in a tightly covered container. Makes about 20 cookies.
