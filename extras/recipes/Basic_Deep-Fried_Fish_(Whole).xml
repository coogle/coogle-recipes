      <step>  1. Have fish cleaned and scaled, but left whole. Wash; then dry well with
  paper toweling. Score on each side with 3 diagonal slashes. Rub lightly
  with salt.
  
  2. Cover fish with any of the coatings indicated below.
  
  3. Heat oil. (Use enough to cover fish completely.) Add fish and deep-fry
  until done, 8 to 15 minutes, depending on size. (Allow about 1 minute on
  each side over high heat, about 4 minutes on each side over medium heat,
  and about 1 minute on each side over high heat again.) Drain on paper
  toweling.
  
  4. Serve hot with a "Sweet-and-Pungent Sauce" or a "Five Willow Sauce", a
  soy sauce dip or "Basic Pepper-Salt Mix" (see recipes). COATINGS FOR
