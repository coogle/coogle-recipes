      <step>  Equipment: 9 by 5 inch loaf pan, lightly oiled
  
  In a small measuring cup, mix the warm water and yeast with a fork to
  dissolve the yeast. Let stand for 3 minutes.
  
  Mix the flour and salt together in a large mixing bowl. Add the yeast
  mixture and the cool water. Using your fingers, mix the dough into a sticky
  mass.
  
  When all of the flour is incorporated, move the dough to a lightly floured
  work surface and knead for 4 minutes. The dough should be sticky and will
  not look smooth. If the dough feels stiff or dry, knead in additional cool
  water, a tablespoon at a time.
  
  Put the dough in a lightly floured bowl, cover, and let rest for 20
  minutes. (This rest period is the autolyse.)
  
  Return the dough to the lightly floured surface and knead it for 7 to 8
  minutes. The dough will go from being sticky to smooth and will become
  supple but not too firm.
  
  Place the dough in a clean bowl lightly dusted with flour. Cover the bowl
  with a towel and allow the dough to rise at room temperature (75 to 77
  degrees F) for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, until it doubles in volume. (An
  indentation made by poking your finger deep into the dough should not
  spring back.)
  
  Place the dough on a very lightly floured surface. Gently deflate the dough
  and pat it into a rectangle. The short sides should be the top and bottom
  edges. Fold the top edge down and the bottom edge up, overlapping them
  slightly, then turn the dough a quarter turn and fold the top down and the
  bottom up again to form an envelope. Shape the dough into a log shape by
  rolling the loaf down two to three times and sealing the seam with the heel
  of your palm. Roll the loaf back and forth on the table to smooth out.
  
  Place the loaf seam side down in a lightly oiled 9 by 5 inch loaf pan.
  Gently press down on the loaf to spread it to fill the corners of the pan,
  and cover it with oiled plastic wrap.
  
  Let the loaf rise at 75 degrees to 77 degrees F for about 1 to 1 1/4 hours,
  or until it has doubled and risen about 1-inch above the edge of the pan.
  
  Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.
  
  Gently place the loaf pan on the center rack of the oven. Using a plant
  sprayer, quickly mist the loaf with water 6 to 8 times, then shut the oven
  door. After 3 minutes, mist the loaf again.
  
  Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 400 degrees F and
  bake for 30 minutes longer, or until the top is a deep golden brown. Remove
  the loaf from the pan it should come out with ease. The bread should sound
  slightly hollow when tapped on the bottom, and the sides of the loaf should
  be brown. Immediately place the loaf from the pan on a wire rack to cool.
  Serve slightly warm, with butter and lots of homemade jam!
