    <directions>
      <step>  Cut corn kernels off the cob and scrape cob with a spoon to collect the
  remaining juices. Season with salt, pepper and bacon bits and spread in a
  thin layer over a shallow pan that has been sprayed with cooking oil spray
  (Pam.) Bake at 400 degrees until heated through.
  
  NOTES : In the original recipe, it calls for bacon drippings as a
  seasoning, to taste, I substituted cooking spray and bacon bits.
