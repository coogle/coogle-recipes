      <step>  Just got back from the Disney Institute again and as always, I had a
  marvelous time. You guys have got to go! I took: Imagineering!, Radio
  Drama, Outdoor Photography, Celebrations!, Boxing Aerobics, Animation
  Sampler, Romantic Dinners, Canoe Adventures and Taste of the Word: Bayou.
  
  Romantic Dinners: Romantic Dinners allows you and your partner (if you
  bring one) to learn what makes an evening romantic and how to prepare a
  delicious and easy meal together. You are not obligated to bring a partner
  so don't worry. With our appetizer and salad course, we were served
  champagne. With dinner, a wonderful white wine was selected. Dessert...
  you'll see. Preheat oven to 350 degree F.
  
  Cut Brie half into four triangles. Stick together two pieces to form a
  rectangle.
  
  Brush olive oil on phyllo sheets. Place the Brie on the phyllo and roll up,
  tucking ends.
  
  Brush olive oil on all exposed surfaces of phyllo.
  
  Place on parchment paper and cook for 5-10 minutes or until golden brown.
