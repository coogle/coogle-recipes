      <step>  Cut the tofu into small rectangles about 1/4--1/2" thick.
  
  In a small bowl, mix together the peanut butter, tamari, and garlic. Slowly
  stir in the water. Mix well.
  
  Place the tofu slices in a shallow dish and pour the liquid over it. Let
  the tofu marinate for at least 30 minutes. If desired, you may leave it for
  several hours or overnight. In this case, keep it refrigerated while it is
  marinating.
  
  When you are ready to cook, remove th pieces of tofu from the marinade and
  place them on a well-oiled cookie sheet. Reserve the liquied to make the
  sauce.
  
  Bake at 375 deg for 30-45 minutes, or until the desired crispness is
  reached (the longer the tofu bakes, the crisper it becomes).
  
  Mix the arrowroot with the remaining marinade. Place the mixture in a
  saucepan and cook over high heat, stirring constantly, until the sauce
  thickens.
  
  Place the baked tofu on a bed of cooked grains (rice, millet, buckwheat or
  even pasta). Cover with the sauce.
  
  Serve with steamed or stir-fried vegetables and a salad.
