    <directions>
      <step>  Roast and peel the peppers as follows: Place the peppers directly
  over a gas jet of the range (or under a pre-heated broiler), turning
  them often with a pair of tongs, until blackened on all sides.
  Transfer them to a bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Let them
  stand until cool. Cut the peppers in half lengthwise and remove the
  stems and seeds. Scrape off the blackened skin of the pepper. Cut the
  peppers into 1/4-inch pieces.
  
  Toss the diced roasted peppers with the basil, balsamic vinegar or
  lemon juice, garlic, salt and pepper in a small bowl. (This salsa may
  be prepared and refrigerated up to one day in advance.)
  
  Prepare pasta according to package directions. While pasta is
  cooking, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add
  the chicken and stir until cooked through, about 4 minutes. Add the
  roasted pepper salsa and stir 30 seconds, scraping up the brown bits
  that stick to the pan. Remove the skillet from the heat.
  
  Drain the pasta, reserving 1/4 cup of the cooking water. Add the
  water and the chicken broth to the skillet with the chicken mixture.
  Return the pasta to the pot. When the chicken is cooked through,
  transfer the contents of the skillet to the pot and heat over high
  heat until the sauce is boiling and reduced enough to lightly coat
  the pasta. Season to taste. Serve hot.
