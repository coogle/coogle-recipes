      <step>  Place all ingredients except sugar in machine. Program for knead and first
  rise and press start. The dough will be sticky at first but will hold its
  shape. After the final cycle, it will be workable. When dough is finished,
  turn the dough out onto a floured surface and let it rest for 10 minutes.
  Roll the dough to a generous 1/4" thick and cut it into 2" squares.
  
  Cover the squares with a clean towel and let rise for 30 minutes. Add the
  powdered sugar to a medium-size clean paper bag. Lay out paper towels to
  drain the doughnuts. Heat 1 to 1 1/2 " of oil to 375Ã¸F. Do not add too
  many; add once or it may cool the oil too much. Gently brush the uncooked
  squares to remove any extra flour. Slide them into the heated oil. When
  they pop to the surface, spoon the hot oil over them constantly until they
  are puffed. Turn the squares and cook until they are a light golden color
  on both sides. It should take 1 to 2 minutes. Cut the first couple of
  squares in half to be sure there is not sticky uncooked dough inside.
  
  Remove from hot oil with slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. While
  warm, drop them, 3 or 4 at a time, into the bag with powdered sugar and
  shake until they are well coated. Serve immediately. Source: Desserts from
