    <directions>
      <step>  Sort throught spiach, discarding stems and bruised or yellow leaves.
  Wash spinach in plenty of cold water; if sandy, wash the second time,
  then spin dry. (or dy on paper toweling.  And water left on the
  leaves will help it to wilt quickly.)
  Heat oil in large saute pan over medium-heat.  Add garlic and lemon
  juice. Saute for 1 minute.
  Turn heat to high.  Add spinach, 1/4 ts salt and a few pinches of
  pepper. Wilt spinach, tossing with tongs to coat leaves with hot oil
  and garlic. Toss in pine nuts.  Add more salt and pepper if DISIRED.
  Serve immeduately.
  
  TO TOAST PINE NUTS:  The nuts can burn quickly, so keep eye on the
  pan. Place nuts in dry skillet and toast them over very low dry
  skillet and toast them over very low heat, stirring or shaking the
  pan as needed until they're golden and fragrant, about 5 minutes.
