    <directions>
      <step>  Melt butter over high heat.  Add sugar, stirring until
  it foams up well. Continue over high heat, adding
  almonds.  Continue to cook, stirring continually until
  mixture is color of mahogany and sugar is all melted.
  (Take it off the heat for a moment if it starts to
  smoke.)
  
  Stir as you take it off the heat permanently and pour
  quickly onto your biggest flat pan with sides.  Tilt
  to spread evenly.  After 5 minutes, pour on chocolate
  chips. When they have melted a bit, spread them over
  the top of the hot mixture with a rubber scraper.
  Scatter ground walnuts over the top, shaking to
  distribute evenly.
  
  Candy is thoroughly cooled when the chocolate is dull
  looking. (Cool at least three hours at room
  temperature.) Break into pieces and it's ready to eat.
