  A paste which, like Balti sauce, appears repeatedly in Balti recipes.
  
  Place the ground spices in a bowl.  Add vinegar, and water sufficient to
  make a paste.  Let stand 10-15 minutes.  Heat the oil in a wok.  Add the
  paste.  Stir-fry until the water content is cooked out (about 3-5 minutes)
  and the paste thickens and begins to bubble with the same kind of boiling
  noise that oatmeal makes. Remove from heat. Bottle while hot in boiled
  jars. When in the bottle, add heated oil to top off, seal, and store.
