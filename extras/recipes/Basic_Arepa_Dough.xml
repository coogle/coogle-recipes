      <step>  Arepas are simple corn cakes first made by the Indians of Colombia and
  Venezuela. They were an important part of their diet, like corn tortillas
  were to the Aztecs.
  
  Over the centuries, the poor people of Colombia and Venezuela continued to
  use them as inexpensive, easy-to-prepare source of nourishment. Today,
  these humble corn cakes are a comfort food for the rich and poor alike, a
  heart-warming tribute to simplicity, tradition, versatility, and good
  taste.
  
  Originally, arepas were made from dried corn kernels that were soaked
  overnight in water and lime to remove the skins, then cooked, drained and
  ground into masa (dough). Thanks to modern technology, a pre-cooked harina
  de masa is now available at most Latin American markets. An instant masa
  can be made by simply mixing this corn flour (either white or yellow) with
  a little salt and enough boiling water to make a stiff dough.
  
  The dough is then shaped into flat round cakes of varying thicknesses,
  depending on the intended use, and cooked on a griddle or deep-fried. In
  parts of Colombia, arepas are cooked atop a flagstone slab that is first
  heated and then brushed with fat. Another Colombian specialty -- arepas de
  chocolo -- are made from fresh corn and cooked on top of banana leaves.
  
  Colombian arepas are generally thinner than their Venezuelan counterparts.
  The standard Venezuelan arepa looks somewhat like a flat bread roll, crispy
  on the outside and doughy on the inside. They can be split open and
  buttered, or spread with cream cheese or fresh goat cheese. Made this way,
  they are served for breakfast or as an accompaniment for grilled fowl,
  fish, meat stews, or sausages.
  
  In Venezuela, the doughy inside is sometimes scooped out, and the shell is
  filled with savory mixtures of ground or chopped pork, beef, ham, chicken,
  seafood, vegetables, or beans. They are excellent first courses. Venezuelan
  mandocas, for example, are cheese arepas shaped into rings and deep-fried.
  Another specialty is bollos pelones -- balls of arepa dough stuffed with
  seasoned ground meat, either fried or poached in water, then served with
  tomato sauce.
  
  A popular snack in Colombia consists of arepas served with fresh cheese and
  fried chorizo (sausage). Colombians also make tasty soups using fresh masa
  or leftover arepas. Arepitas dulces make great desserts.
  
  The versatile arepa indeed proves that unpretentioius food can be not only
  satisfying but also delicious.
  
  Directions:
  
  In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Add water, stir with a
  wooden spoon to make a soft dough. Let stand for 5 minutes, then knead for
  3 minutes. Dough is ready to be shaped into standard arepas, or to be mixed
  and kneaded with other ingredients such as cheese, chicharrones (pork
  rind), etc.
  
  To shape arepas: The standard Venezuelan arepa is 3 inches in diameter, 3/4
  inch thick. Columbian arepas are larger and thinner, about 4 inches in
  diameter, 1/4 inch thick. To make arepas, oil or wet hands lightly and
  shape dough into balls. Place between 2 pieces of wax paper or plastic wrap
  and flatten into a circle; shape the edges to form a smooth disc.
  
  To cook arepas: Heat a griddle or cast iron skillet over medium heat;
  grease lightly and cook arepas on both sides, turning a couple of times
  until a crust is formed. Colombian arepas are ready to be served at this
  point, spread with butter. Venezuelan arepas have to be baked in a preheate
  350-degree oven for 15 minutes. To check for doneness, tap the arepa
  lightly -- if a hollow sound is heard, it's ready. Split open, add butter
  and serve hot.
  
  Arepas freeze well if frozen while still warm. Freeze in layers separated
  by plastic wrap. Reheat frozen arepas wrapped in aluminum foil in a
  preheated 350-degree oven for 10 minutes or until heared through.
