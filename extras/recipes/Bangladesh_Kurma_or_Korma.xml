  1.  Heat the gee and mix the saffron powder or coloring with milk. 2. Heat
  the oil and quickly 'seal' the chicken cubes by turning frequently for 2
  minutes, then add the yellow milk and stir-fri for 2 minutes. 3. Add the
  garlic and stir-fry for 1 minute, then add onion and stir-fry for 3 minutes
  ~ enough to remove the moisture content. Now add the garam masala and
  stir-fry for 2 more minutes.  Your total frying time is around 10 minutes,
  and the chicken is half cooked. 4. Add the yoghurt, cream and ground
  almonds and when it starts to simmer turn the heat down and stir-fry for 10
  minutes more to ensure it does not stick, adding milk or water as
  necessary. 5.  Place saffron strands in a little warm water and extract as
  much color as you can by gently mashing with a teaspoon. 6. Check that the
  chicken is cooked right through by cutting a large piece across. Simmer on
  if required. Just prior to serving add the saffron and salt to taste.
  Garnish with the coriander and almonds, and serve immediatley.
