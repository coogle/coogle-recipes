  Scottish Shortbread: As far as shortbread is concerned, I'm a great
  believer in simplicity. The recipe for Balmoral Shortbread below is typical
  of this style.
  
  However, with Scots cookery, one should never ignore Mistress Margaret
  (Meg) Dods. Her "Cook's and Housewife's Manual" was promoted (ghosted?) by
  Sir Walter Scott, who coined her pseudonym. The recipe for Petticoat Tails
  is described by Catherine Brown (Scottish Regional Recipes) as "a ladies'
  shortbread - men generally prefer thick fingers".
  
  Other recipes call for additions such as rice flour, cornflour
  (cornstarch), lemon peel, ground or slivered almonds (or almond essence)
  but these are all just curlicues. As for the commercially produced Choc
  Chip Shortbread and Cherry Shortbread ... they are about as Scots as the
  Taj Mahal.
  
  Note the 3:2:1 ratio - what could be simpler.
  
  Preheat oven to 350F / 180C / Gas 4
  
  Sift flour onto a board.  Put sugar in a separate pile on the board, and
  work in butter.  Gradually knead in flour: you should end up with a firm
  dough.  Flour the board and roll to a thickness of 3mm to 5mm.  Cut into
  circles and prick with a fork.  Bake on a greased tray for 30 minutes.
