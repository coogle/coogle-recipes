      <step>  This is my Mom's invention. She used to make her own from scratch back in
  the 1940's. I remeber peering into the big brown bowl with the white beans
  soaking into it, but found she could use this recepie without loss of
  flavor and with much saving of time and effort. My brother and I used to
  use this for hugh parties in graduate student days. We once made it with 15
  cans of beans for a big crowd and with no loss of flavor. You can make it ,
  either parev, without the ffranks or Fleishig.
  
  Mix all ingredients and put in a covered baking dish or cassarole and bake
  in a 350 F oven for at least 30 min. You will neeed more time if you are
  making alot, as the mass has to heat through and cook for a while.
