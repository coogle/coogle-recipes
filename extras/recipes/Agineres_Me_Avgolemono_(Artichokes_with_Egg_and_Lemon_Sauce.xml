      <step>  The classic Greek sauce, avgolemono, is a great low-fat alternative
  to the melted butter, mayonnaise or vinaigrette dipping sauces
  usually served with artichokes.
  
  Snap the stems off four large artichokes and trim the bases so that
  they will sit upright on a plate.  Boil a potful of water to which
  you have added the juice of a lemon and a pinch of salt.  Drop the
  artichokes in and boil for 30 minutes or until they are tender.  Test
  by pulling off an outer leaf and trying the flesh at the base for
  tenderness.
  
  Meanwhile, in another saucepan, bring a cup of chicken stock to the
  boil. In a cup, mix about two-thirds of a tablespoon of cornflour
  with a little water until it is smooth and add to the boiling stock,
  stirring until it thickens.
  
  Separate 3 eggs, beat the whites until they hold stiff peaks, then
  add the yolks and continue beating tin the whole mass is fluffy.
  Still beating, add the juice of a lemon and pour in the boiling
  stock.  Pour this mixture back into the stock saucepan, and stir it
  over a low heat for a couple of minutes.  It must not boil.
  
  Place the artichokes in the centre of warmed plates and pour the
  avgolemono over them.  Serve.
  
  Makes 4 servings.
