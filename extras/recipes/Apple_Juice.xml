      <step>  Quality: Good quality apple juice is made from a blend of varieties. For
  best results, buy fresh juice from a local cider maker within 24 hours
  after it has been pressed.
  
  Procedure: Refrigerate juice for 24 to 48 hours. Without mixing, carefully
  pour off clear liquid and discard sediment. Strain clear liquid through a
  paper coffee filter or double layers of damp cheesecloth.
  
  Heat quickly, stirring occasionally, until juice begins to boil. Fill
  immediately into sterile pint or quart jars or fill into clean half-gallon
  jars, leaving 1/4-inch headspace. Adjust lids and process.
