      <step>  Around the Arabian Gulf, highly spiced food is still common: recipes from
  the region call for complex spice blends, often with chilies. Enthusiasm
  for rich spicing passes to North Africa, to Ethiopia and the countries of
  the Magreb (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), where food is spiced with
  pepper, cubebs, cumin, caraway, cinnamon and cassia, ginger and saffron.
  Chilies and mild peppers are common too, but not all the food is
  ferociously hot; many Moroccan dishes are quite delicate and subtle in
  their flavoring. Further south, in both East and West Africa, chilies are
  the dominant flavoring. Elsewhere in the Middle East, subtle spicing
  prevails in the Arab countries, Iran and Turkey.
