  Here is an apple ring recipe from our Kerr Home Canning Book, published
  1948:
  
  Select firm apples that will not mush in processing. Prepare a thin or
  medium syrup (see below). Flavor the syrup with cinnamon according to taste
  and add enough red food coloring to give desired shade to apples. Peel
  apples, leave whole, quarter or slice, boil 3 to 5 minutes in the syrup.
  Pack in to clean Kerr jars and fill to within 1/2 inch of top of jar with
  syrup in which the apples were precooked. Put on cap, screwing band firmly
  tight. Process 25 minutes in a boiling water bath or 10 minutes in pressure
  cooker.
