      <step>  Yesterday we introduced the members of Recipe-a-Day to Soda Bread as
  prepared in cake form. Today is the same recipe, but prepared as the farl.
  This type of preparation is found more often in Northern Ireland and served
  as a part of a traditional Irish Breakfast, or Ulster Fry is you prefer.
  
  Sift the dry ingredients together several times in a large mixing bowl to
  make sure the bicarbonate of soda is evenly distributed. Create a well in
  the center of the dry ingredients and a pour about three-quarters of the
  buttermilk into the center and start stirring. Continue to mix until you
  achieve a dough that is raggy and very soft. Add more buttermilk sparingly
  is you need it, as local conditions of humidity and temperature greatly
  impact the mixture.
  
  Blend quickly, but not too energetically until the whole mass of dough has
  become a floury, raggy consistency. Turn the contents of the bowl out onto
  a lightly floured surface and start to knead the bread.
  
  Your primary concern is speed in kneading. The chemical reaction of the
  bicarbonate of soda with the acidic buttermilk starts as soon as they meet.
  You need to get the Soda Bread into the oven while the reactions running
  high, so don't over knead. Spend about 30-seconds kneading the dough and
  shape the bread into a slightly domed circle about 6 to 8-inches in
  diameter. Cut the circle of dough into four equal sections and try not to
  crush or compress the dough when you make the cuts. A clean slicing motion
  with a sharp knife is required.
  
  To complete the farl prepare your best cast iron griddle or fry pan for
  cooking. Pre-heat the pan over a medium-low setting. Dust a hot griddle or
  frying pan with a little flour, and place the farl or farls gently on the
  hot griddle. The cut edges should be 1/2 inch or so apart to allow for
  expansion during cooking. Grill or fry the farls about 20-minutes on each
  side until well toasted in color. The farls will scorch easily, so keep an
  eye on the heat and adjust accordingly. The heat source should be very low
  when the farls are finished.
