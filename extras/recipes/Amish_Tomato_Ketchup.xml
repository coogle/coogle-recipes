      <step>  Place the celery, onions and water in a medium-size saucepan over medium
  high heat, cover, and bring to a boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until
  the vegetables are nearly soft, about 25 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, cook tomatoes in a large heavy nonreactive saucepan over medium
  heat, partially covered, until they are very soft and almost a puree, about
  25 minutes. Add the cooked celery and onions; continue cooking until the
  vegetables are completely softened, about 15 minutes.
  
  Strain tomato mixture in small batches through a sieve into another
  nonreactive saucepan, pressing down firmly to extract all of the liquid.
  Stir in the vinegar, brown sugar and spices. Place the pan over medium high
  heat and bring to a boil.  Continue boiling, stirring often to be sure that
  the ketchup isn't sticking to the bottom of the pan, until the mixture
  thickens somewhat, 15 to 20 minutes. Allow ketchup to cool, then ladle into
  jars.  Cover and refrigerate for up to 2 months. Or ladle the boiling-hot
  ketchup into hot sterilized canning jars. Seal according to the lid
  manufacturer's instructions.
  
  Yield: 1 1/2 pints.
  
  Loomis writes:  "This sweet ketchup comes from Mary Linebach, who owns and
  runs a produce auction with her [Mennonite] husband, Paul, in Shippensburg,
  Pennsylvania."  [Mary describes the ketchup by saying]: 'The children love
  it on pancakes...It's sweeter than store-bought and not as tangy...'
  
  "The ketchup is good on morning hotcakes (an Amish custom) as it is on
  Cheddar cheese sandwiches, as a dip for fresh vegetables or freshly baked
  bread, and as a condiment with roast or fried meat or poultry. And it has
  one distinct advantage over the most popular store-bought brand: You won't
  have any trouble getting it out of the bottle, because it's not thick."
