      <step>   Platina mentions several odd fishes not usually used today as food, such
  as cuttlefish, scorpions, lampreys and sea-lion. But most of his fish are
  still favorites-eels, lobsters, crabs, oysters, sturgeon and sturgeon eggs
  (which he calls caviar),  salmon, sole, etc., and he gives a recipe for a
  Squid Dish for Days of Abstinence. Although squid is eaten today in the
  South of France and Greece, and can be found in special fish shops here, I
  would prefer salmon or halibut. But if you hanker for squid, just go ahead
  with it if you can find some, and be sure to have the fish man prepare it
  for you by removing the black liquid from the backbone. A SQUID DISH FOR
  DAYS OF ABSTINENCE--1475 Boil the squid. Crush what is good in a mortar.
  Prepare a paste of almonds with rosewater strained through a sieve; or, if
  you can't provide this, use the juice of peas or white chickpeas. Crush
  together small grapes and five figs. Mix a little rock parsley and a little
  fresh marjoram leaves. Add as much cinnamon, ginger and sugar as is
  necessary. Mix these well with whites of eggs so that they will stick
  together and cook better. With the mixture well greased, and with a crust
  above and beneath, set it on the hearth at a little distance from the
  flame. Sprinkle sugar and rosewater on the cooked mixture. This dish
  assails all the members.
