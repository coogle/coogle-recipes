  Mix 1 st 3 ingreds. in 3 qt. glass bowl with wooden spoon until smooth.
  Cover; let stand in warm, draft-free place for 8 hours. Add 3-3/4 C flour,
  sugar, salt, baking soda and oil to the mixture in bowl. Stir with wooden
  spoon until smooth and flour is completely absorbed. (Dough should be just
  firm enough to gather into a ball. If necessary, add remaining 1/2 C flour
  gradually, stirring until all flour is absorbed.) Turn dough onto heavily
  floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Place in
  greased bowl; turn greased side up. Cover; let rise in warm place until
  double, about 1-1/2 hours. (Dough is ready if indentation remains when
  touched.) Punch dough down; divide into halves. Shape each half into a
  round,  slightly flat loaf. Do not tear dough by pulling. Place loaves in
  opposite corners of greased cookie sheet. Make three 1/4" deep slashes in
  each loaf. Let rise until double, about 45 minutes. Heat oven to 375. Brush
  loaves with cold water. Place cookie sheet in center of oven; it should not
  touch the sides of the oven. Bake, brushing occasionally with water, until
  loaves sound hollow when tapped, about 50 minutes. Remove from cookie
  sheets; cool on wire racks.
  
  Be sure to let dough rise completely both times - it might take longer than
  the estimated times given.
