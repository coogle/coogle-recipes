      <step>  Hello Everyone! I'm new to the list (as of yesterday) so I don't know all
  of the in's and out's of the list but I have noticed that the recipes today
  have been low fat. So I'm sharing with you a "recipe" I got off of Party at
  Home on HGTV yesterday. Its not really so much of a recipe but here
  goes.....
  
  Peel the bananas and slice. Place slices in freezer bag and freeze. Once
  frozen, put in food processor and process until creamy.
  
  That's it! You would not believe how close the consistency is to ice cream.
  My husband kept asking me what was in it and wouldn't believe that it was
  just bananas. I went back and added a dash of cinnamon and that was good
  too.
