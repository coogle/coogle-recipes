      <step>    Such a special treat. Apple seeds were brought from England, but the
  wonderful flavor of maple syrup was here waiting for those apples. This is
  the legitimate ancestor of the more common baked apple.
  
    Place the apples in a tightly fitting baking dish, cut side up. Mix the
  remaining ingredients and pour over the apples. Bake at 350Ã¸, uncovered,
  for 1-1/2 to 2 hours, or until the apples are soft and the syrup has
  reduced and is fairly thick. Baste 3 or 4 times during the baking process.
