  Low-Fat, High-Flavor Dining (This must be a winter menu.) An All-American
  Lowfat Feast by Lou Seibert Pappas
  
  Wash the turkey inside and out and pat dry. Rub the entire surface as well
  as the cavity with lemon juice and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place the
  turkey breast side up on the grill of a barbecue over medium hot coals,
  cover with a kettle lid, and barbecue until a meat thermometer registers
  170 degrees F, about 3 to 3 1/2 hours. Transfer to a board. Let the turkey
  rest for 15 to 20 minutes before carving. Garnish the platter with a wreath
  of rosemary and oregano.
  
  Makes about 12 servings.
