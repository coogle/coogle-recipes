      <step>  Here's a recipe for Almond Joy Cake that I made to take to our church
  potluck dinner tomorrow. I got the recipe from one of the recipe lists
  awhile back. It was submitted by a person named Penchard. It looks and
  smells so good that I may not be able to keep my husband out of it until
  tomorrow.
  
  Bake cake as directed on package. Combine in large saucepan 1 cup
  evaporated milk and 1 cup sugar, bring to boil and stir in marshmallows
  until melted. Add coconut, and pour over cake while both are hot. Melt
  together the remaining milk, butter and chocolate chips. Stir until melted,
  and add the almond slices. Pour on top of warm cake.
  
  NOTE: I baked mine in a 9x13 pan. I also poked some holes in the top of the
  baked cake before pouring the coconut mixture over all. Posted to TNT -
