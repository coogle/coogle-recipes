  Mix all sauce ingredients together. Use as a basting sauce for the meat.
  The pork has to be barbecued - that is, cooked long and slow over a real
  wood fire, preferably hickory. Temp should be around 220 degrees, and it
  takes at least 1-1/2 hours per pound, or until internal temp. reaches
  150-160 degrees. Needless to say, this is difficult to accomplish in the
  average backyard Weber kettle, although it can be done. It has to be served
  on a CWB: Cheap White Bun. After that, the only question is "with or
  without?" Sweet cole slaw on top, that is.
