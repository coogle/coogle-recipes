    <directions>
      <step>  Place ingredients in the bread machine in the order listed.  Use the dough
  
  setting. Add the apricots 5 minutes before the end of the kneading phase or
  work into the dough before shaping. If you don't have a dough setting stop
  the
  
  machine after the rises.
  
  Prepare the baking sheets or use nonstick sheets. Remove dough from the
  machine, punch it down, and roll it out into a rectangle about 14 x 18.
  Divide into equal pieces and shape into bagel form or use a cutter. Place
  the bagels on the sheets and let them rise again.  I put them in the oven
  to provide a draft free location.
  
  This rise can be anywhere from 20 minutes to 4 hours depending on what else
  is going on in your life.
  
  Fill a 4 to 6 qt soup pot with water 3 to 4 " deep.  You can add 2 T of
  malt syrup, honey, sugar or non-diastatic malt powder. Get the water to
  boiling.
  
  Preheat the oven to 400.
  
  Drop the bagels one at a time into the boiling water.  Boil only 3 or 4 at
  a time so they don't crowd. Simmer each side for a minute and return to the
  
  baking sheet.
  
  Add glazes or toppings as desired.
  
  Bake just below the middle of a preheated 400 degree oven.  The book calls
  for 20 to 25 minutes. I usually start at 15 minutes for the 1st sheet and
  less for the second.
  
  These are best eaten while they are still warm.  They can be frozen - you
  may want to slice them first so you can defost them in the toaster.
  
  Serving Ideas : for peach bagels sub dried peaches for the apricots
  
  NOTES : I use orange oil instead of the orange extract. These are really
  excellent.
