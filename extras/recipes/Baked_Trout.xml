  This is a simple way I like to prepare them which I think is delicious,
  although I don't usually fillet them....just clean/gut them etc...:
  
  Place the trout or fillets onto a large enough piece of foil to wrap in.
  Brush the foil with some virgin olive oil and brush the fish with some oil
  too. Season it with some salt and black pepper.  Finely chop the herbs with
  the garlic to make a herb/garlic pesto and sprinkle over the trout to cover
  completely.  Or, if using whole trout, stuff into the cavity.  Lay a few
  thin slices of lemon over the top and wrap the foil tightly. Place in a
  baking dish and bake in the oven until done...this depends on the size of
  the fish so I don't know how long....it could take around 20 minutes or so
  on average. When cooked, remove from the foil, remove the lemon slices and
  drizzle some more olive oil over the top if you wish and serve with wedges
  of lemon.
