    <directions>
      <step>  MICROWAVE INSTRUCTIONS: Prepare popcorn as directed on the packaged. Remove
  any unpopped kernels. In a large bowl, combine popcorn, cereal, crackers,
  shoestring poatoes and peanuts.
  
  Place margarine in a 2-cup microwave-safe measuring cup. Microwave on high
  for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes or until melted. Stir in parsley flakes, chili
  powder, onion powder, and garlic powder. Drizzle seasoned mixture over
  popcorn mixture. Sprinkle with cheese. Toss until evenly coated. Transfer
  half of mixture to ungreased 12x8 inch microwave safe dish. Microwave on
  HIGH for 3 minutes or until thorougly heated, stirring once halfway through
  heating. Spread on paper towels to cool. Repeat with remaining mixture.
  Makes 12 cups.
  
  The garlic in this popcorn keeps vampires from getting too friendly!
  Another way people used to keep vampires away was to scatter mustard seeds
  on their roofs. Supposedly if a vampire saw some mustard seeds he would
  have to stop and count each one. People scattered so many mustard seeds on
  their roofs that it would take all night for the vampire to count them. By
  that time it was dawn and the vampire had to return to its grave.
