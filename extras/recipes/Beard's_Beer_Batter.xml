      <step>  The ultimate batter for deep frying... DIRECTIONS:
  
  BEER!  Whether it's ale, lager, pilsener, or stout, is terrific for
  cooking. Beer makes a batter for deep frying and smooths a French onion
  soup.  And what could be more compatible for lunch on a rainy Vancouver
  weekend out on the boat fishing for Spring salmon than a cold beer with a
  hot pastrami sandwich smothered with brown beer mustard?
  
  This is the late James Beard's recipe for batter to French fry vegetables.
  Trim your veggies, wash, dry thoroughly, dust with flour, dip into the
  batter, and fry in oil at 360 F. until done. However, James "missed the
  boat" on this one - it's far better for deep frying halibut, cod, or any
  other seafood.  The batter puffs up because of the beer's yeast, fries
  quickly, and as a result, doesn't commit the cardinal sin of seafood
  preparation - overcooking.  I think few of our piscine friends benefit from
  deep frying as a cooking method, but that's another story.
  
  To prepare, place flour in a mixing bowl and add egg yolks, salt, oil, and
  beer.  Stir batter until thoroughly mixed. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and
  allow it to rest in the fridge for at least 2 hours or as long as 24 - the
  longer the better, to a point. Just before using batter, stir it well
  again.  In a separate bowl, beat egg whites until stiff but not dry; gently
  fold egg whites into batter.  Does 2 lbs. of veggies or 6 fish fillets,
  depending upon their size.
  
  Makes 4 servings.
