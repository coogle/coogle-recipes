    <ingredients/>
    <directions>
      <step>   1 cups beef, chicken, or vegetable stock 1 cup bread or all-purpose flour
  1 cup whole wheat or rye (or other dark) flour 1 cup bulgar wheat 1/4 cup
  non-fat dry milk powder 1/2 tsp. salt 1-1/2 tsp. yeast
  
  Use dough cycle. Roll dough to 1/4" thickness. Cut with cookie cutters or
  knife. Place on baking sheets sprinkled with cornmeal. Cover with clean
  kitchen towels and let rise in warm place about 45 minutes. Bake at
  325-degrees for 45 minutes. When all are baked, turn off oven and return
  all cookies to cooling oven overnight to harden. Store in airtight
  container. [Using a 3.5" bone shaped cutter, I get about 30-35 cookies from
  this recipe. Sam the Wonder Dog adores them.]
