    <directions>
      <step>  To help blend the cheeses smoothly let them stand for 30 minutes at room
  temperature before processing.
  
  Place Brie and Camembert cheeses in a food processor or mixer bowl. Process
  or beat until nearly smooth. Gradually add cream cheese, processing till
  smooth after each addition. Stir in nuts. Season with salt and pepper.
  Spoon pate into an 8" quiche dish. Set aside.
  
  Cut puff pastry into an 8" circle. Place on a small baking sheet. Cut small
  decorative designs from trimmings; brush bottoms of designs with a little
  water and attach to top of the pastry round. Combine egg yolk and 1
  tablespoon water in a small bowl. Brush egg mixture over pastry. Bake puff
  pastry round at 400F 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from oven
  and set aside.
  
  Reduce oven temperature to 350F. Bake cheese mixture 7-9 minutes or until
  just warm. Remove from oven.
  
  Carefully place baked pastry round atop the cheese mixture. Serve warm.
  Makes 8-10 servings.
