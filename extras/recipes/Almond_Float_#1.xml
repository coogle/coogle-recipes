    <directions>
      <step>  1. Prepare the sweetened water (see recipe below).
  
  2. Blanch almonds. Place half of them in a blender with water and blend to
  a smooth paste.
  
  3. Strain mixture into a bowl through a double thickness of cheesecloth.
  Gather up corners of the cheesecloth and squeeze out every last drop of
  liquid; then discard residue.
  
  4. Repeat this process with remaining almonds and the second quantity of
  water.
  
  5. Break agar-agar in 1-inch sections and place in a saucepan with
  remaining water. Bring to a boil, stirring, and cook until agar-agar
  dissolves and begins to thicken. Then stir in almond liquid and cook 1
  minute more.
  
  6. Pour the mixture into a shallow rectangular pan. Let cool; then
  refrigerate until set. Cut in 1/2-inch cubes or diamond shapes.
  
  7. Transfer to a deep serving dish. Serve with enough sweetened water
  poured over so almond cubes float. Garnish with slivered almonds, fresh
  strawberries or canned fruit such as mandarin orange sections, pineapple
  chunks, lichees or fruit cocktail.
  
  NOTE: This dish has many names--Almond Curd (because it's similar in
  consistency to bean curd), Almond Junket, and Almond Lake. It can be
  converted to a party punch by cutting the almond curd into finer pieces and
  using more of the sweetened water. VARIATIONS:
  
  1. For the sweetened water, substitute the heavy syrup of any canned fruit.
  
  2. In step 2, grind the almonds instead; then bring to a boil with 3 cups
  water and simmer, covered, 5 minutes. Strain through the cheesecloth as in
  step 3. SWEETENED WATER:
  
  1. Bring 2 cups water to a boil. Stir in 1/2 cup sugar and cook, stirring,
  until dissolved.
  
  2. Let cool; then refrigerate to chill. (Allow about 1/4 cup sweetened
  water per serving.) VARIATIONS:
  
  1. For the sugar, use either brown sugar; or about 1/4 pound rock candy.
  
  2. In step 1, also add 1/2 cup light syrup from canned mandarin oranges.
  
  3. After step 1, stir in 1 teaspoon almond extract.
