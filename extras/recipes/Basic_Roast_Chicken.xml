    <directions>
      <step>  1. Wipe chicken with a damp cloth. Dry well with paper toweling; or hang up
  to dry in a cool, airy place for 1 to 2 hours. Transfer to a deep bowl.
  
  2. Prepare any marinade for roast chicken (see any recipe "... for Roast
  Chicken": "Five Spices", "Scallion-Honey", "Tangerine Peel", or "Hoisin".)
  Then pour over chicken and rub into skin. Let stand 1 to 2 hours, turning
  occasionally. Drain, reserving marinade.
  
  3. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place chicken on a rack over a drip pan
  containing several inches of water (this will keep the drippings from
  burning).  Roast until bird is tender and browned, basting with marinade at
  15-minute intervals and turning bird occasionally. (Allow about 30 minutes
  roasting time per pound.)
  
  4. With a cleaver, chop chicken, bones and all, in 2-inch sections; or
  carve Western-style, and serve. VARIATION: After step 2, brush bird with
  melted chicken fat.
