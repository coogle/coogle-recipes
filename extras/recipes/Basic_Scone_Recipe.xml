  Place the baking sheet in the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F.  Sift the
  measured flour twice with the baking powder, salt, and other fine
  ingredients such as powdered mustard (which you would use if you were
  making cheese scones).
  
  Dice the fats into the dry ingredients, then lightly rub in with cool
  fingertips or a pastry blender until completely blended.
  
  Make a well in the center and stir in the milk.  Lightly mix with a fork
  until the ingredients form a soft dough.
  
  Turn out onto a floured board and knead very lightly for about 30 seconds
  to a loose, smooth dough. Roll out with a rolling pin to approximately 3/4
  inch thick.
  
  Stamp out with a 2-inch cutter or cut into triangles with a sharp knife.
  Lightly knead together any trimmings and roll and stamp out again.  Lift
  with a spatula onto the HOT baking sheet, placing 1 inch apart. Brush only
  the tops with lightly beaten egg or milk.
  
  Bake toward the top of the oven for approximately 10 minutes, or until well
  risen and golden brown.  Lift onto a wire rack with the spatula to cool.
  (If you were to make cheese scones, you would add 1 3/4 cups very finely
  grated mature cheddar cheese, and a pinch of dry English mustard)
  
  Clotted cream is a spread somewhat similar to butter, but not the same.  I
  don't know if it is possible to get in the U.S..I seem to recall that I may
  have seen instructions for making it in one of those "Cheaper and Better"
  type books. I'll look. (Any Brits out there with better Info than me?)
