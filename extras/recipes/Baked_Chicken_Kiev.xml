    <directions>
      <step>  Rinse chicken and pat dry.  Place one piece at a time, skinned side down,
  between two sheets of pastic wrap and pound with a flat surface mallet
  until each breast is about 1/8 inch thick. In a shallow bowl, combine bread
  crumbs, parmesan cheese, garlic salt and pepper and 1 tsp of the oregano
  and set aside. In a small bowl, stir together the 1/4 cup butter, remaining
  oregano and parsley.  Arrange the pounded chicken breasts skinned side
  down.  Spread about 1/2 tablespoon of the butter mixture across each piece
  about an inch from one of the long sides and place a strip of the Jack
  cheese over the butter. Fold the short ends over the filling and then fold
  in the long sides and roll to enclose the filling. Dip each bundle into the
  6 tbsp of melted butter, drain and roll in the bread crumb mixture until
  coated evenly and well. Place bundles, seam side down and slightly
  separated into a 10x15 inch rimmed baking pan. Drizzle with the remaining
  butter. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours over overnight. Bake
  uncovered in a 425 F oven until chicken is no longer pink when slightly
  slashed (Don't cut the filling!!), about 20 minutes. Serve at once!!
  MEXICAN STYLE KIEV: Follow the directions above, but omit the oregano.
  Instead use a mixture of 1 tsp chili powder and 1/2 tsp ground cumin. Using
  a can of whole green chiles, discard the ptih and any seeds. Cut the
  chilies into 1 inch stirps and divide into eight equal portions. When
  filling the chicken breasts, place one portion of the chile, atop each
  strip of cheese. serve the chicken with the following tomatoe sauce. Stir
  together 1-15oz can of tomatoe sauce with 1/2 tsp each ground cumin and
  sugar and 1/4 cup sliced green onions ( including tops.) Cook over medium
  heat, stirring, until hot. Season to taste with salt, pepper and hot pepper
  sauce.
