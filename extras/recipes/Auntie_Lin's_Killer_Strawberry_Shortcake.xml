      <step>  This is a really easy dessert, loaded with calories, and not for the
  faint-of-heart!
  
  Make the bisquick drop biscuits as directed on the package, BUT add 1
  tb of sugar (or 2, if you like). Bake as directed.
  
  While still warm, cut in half and put the bottom half in a bowl.
  Cover with fresh strawberries (which you have marinated in 4 Tb sugar
  in the refrigerator for 2 days), add a scoop or two of French vanilla
  ice cream, and then top with the top layer of the biscuit.
  
  Now, cover with more strawberries and top with fresh whipped cream.
  
  Enjoy!
