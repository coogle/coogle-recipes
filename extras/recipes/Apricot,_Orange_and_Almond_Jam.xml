      <step>  Chop the apricots roughly.  Put them into a large bowl, sprinkling the fine
  grated zest of the oranges and the cinnamon between layers. Squeeze the
  juice of the oranges, measure and add enough water to make 3 pints in all.
  Pour the liquids over the fruit; leave to soak overnight in a cool place.
  
  Slide the contents of the bowl into a preserving pan and simmer gently
  until the fruit is beautifully tender. Check the fruit occasionally as it
  cooks and crush it down into the pan with a potato masher. It may need 1
      1/4    hours to become really soft.
  
  Warm the sugar.  Add it to the pan together with the juice of the lemons
  and the almonds.  Cook gently until sugar is melted, then fast-boil until
  the saucer test shows that the preserve will set. Pot, tie down and label
  the preserve in the usual way.
