      <step>   (This is for "Thai Iced Coffee: Make *very* strong coffee (50-100% more
  coffee to water than usual), use something like Cafe Du Monde which has
  chicory in it. Pour 6-8 oz into cup and add about 1 Tbs sweetened condensed
  milk.  Stir, then pour over ice.)
  
   Make even stronger coffee, preferably in a Vietnamese coffee maker.  (This
  is a metal cylinder with tiny holes in the bottom and a perforated disc
  that fits into it; you put coffee in the bottom of the cylinder, place the
  disc atop it, then fill with boiling water and a very rich infusion of
  coffee drips slowly from the bottom.)
  
   If you are using a Vietnamese coffee maker, put two tablespoons of
  sweetened condensed milk in the bottom of a cup and put the coffee maker on
  top of the cup.  If you are making espresso or cafe filtre (the infusion
  method where you press the plunger down through the grounds after several
  minutes of infusion), mix the sweetened condensed milk and the coffee any
  way you like.
  
   When the milk is dissolved in the coffee (yes, dissolved *is* the right
  word here!), pour the combination over ice and sip.
