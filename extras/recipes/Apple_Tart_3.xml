      <step>  In a small skillet, heat 3/4 cup sugar, stirring constantly until it is
  liquified and just golden. Remove from the heat and quickly pour into a 10"
  pie plate; set aside. In a small bowl, combine the flour, cinnamon and
  remaining sugar. Arrange half of the apples in a single layer in a circular
  pattern in pie plate. Sprinkle with half of the sugar mixture. Arrange half
  of the remaining apples in a circular patter over sugar, sprinkle with the
  remaining sugar mixture. Place remaining apples over all, keeping the top
  as level as possible. Dot with butter. Roll out pastry to 9 inches; place
  over apples, pressing gently to completely cover. Do not flute. Bake at 400
  F. for 50 minutes or until apples are tender. As soon as tart comes out of
  the oven, carefully invert onto a large serving plate and remove pie plate.
