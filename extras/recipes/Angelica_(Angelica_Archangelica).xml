      <step>  "Angelica has a variety of culinary uses.  Its unique flavor is difficult
  to describe except by listing its components: musky, bitter, celerylike,
  aniselike, slightly sweet, fresh. The hollow stems are jellied or candied
  (see recipe below) and either eaten alone or used to decorate desserts.
  About 1/4 cup fresh angelica stems, cut in short pieces, can be added to
  rhubarb to counteract its tartness and reduce the necessary sugar by as
  much as one-third.  The stems and dried roots are sometimes boiled like
  celery and can be cooked with sugar like rhubarb. The slightly bitter
  leaves may be served with fish, and sometimes are candied with the stems.
  
  "Consuming large amounts of angelica can cause photosensitivity in some
  individuals, and pregnant women should avoid using any part of the plant.
  Commercially, the seeds and see oil flavor liqueurs and desserts, and scent
  cosmetics.  The pungent, juniper-flavored roots are used with or instead of
  juniper berries to flavor gin.  Arkansas or Quapaw Indians mixed the root
  of A. atropurpurea with tobacco for smoking. The robust angelica stalks are
  handsome in dried arrangements, and the coumarin-containing leaves
  sometimes serve as a potpourri fixative."
  
  CANDIED ANGELICA STEMS ====================== The best stems for candying
  are the new growth in the second year. Cut them into manageable pieces,
  then blanch 1-2 minutes. Peel the blanched stems, them cut them into pieces
  2 inches long by 1/2 inch wide.  Simmer 20 minutes in a syrup made of the
  sugar and water. Drain, reserving the syrup, and refrigerate stems and
  syrup, covered, for four days. Reheat the angelica in the syrup and cook
  for 20 minutes, or until candied. The temperature of the syrup should reach
  238 F. Drain the angelica and dry on racks set over waxed paper. Store in
  airtight containers.
  
  [NOTE: For safety's sake, do not gather angelica in the wild. Wild angelica
  is easily confused with the deadly poisonous lookalike, water hemlock
  (Cicula maculata).]
