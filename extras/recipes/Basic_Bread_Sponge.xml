      <step>  Whisk the yeast into the water.  Allow to sit for about three minutes. Add
  the flour, mixing for another three minutes.  Place in a nonreactive bowl
  and cover.  Allow to sit in a draft-free spot until it rises and gets
  
  thick and sticky.  This will take about eight hours.
  
  Use a spoon to stir the sponge down before measuring for use in a bread.
  
  Once risen, refrigerate for up to three days.  Allow to come to room
  temperature before using.  If it goes beyond three days, discard all but 1
  
  cup of the sponge and make the recipe, adding the reserved sponge with the
  
  flour.  Stir for two or three minutes before using.
  
  For all of the breads based upon this sponge, allow two days since the
  doughs require overnight refrigeration.
  
  For the best results, use as little of the kneading flour as possible.
  
  To allow yourself to slide the loaves into the oven, form them on a baking
  
  sheet without sides or on the bottom of one with sides that is turned
  upside-down.
  
  If you do not have a stone or tiles, bake directly on the baking sheet(s)
  upon which you formed the loaves (be sure to use either cornmeal or
  parchment between the dough and the sheet).
  
  All of the breads based upon the sponge can be frozen for up to two weeks.
  
  Don't freeze until the bread has cooled thoroughly - then wrap in foil and
  freeze.  When ready to use, thaw them, still wrapped, at room temperature
  overnight.  Then, unwrap and warm at 350 degrees for 5 or 10 minutes.
  Alternatively, you could warm the frozen and wrapped loaves at
      300    for 35 to 40 minutes.
