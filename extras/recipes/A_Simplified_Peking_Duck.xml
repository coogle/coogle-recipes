      <step>  Bring a pot of water, large enough to hold the duck, to a boil. Remove from
  heat and plunge duck in the water for 5 minutes. Remove and pat dry.
  
  Combine the rest of the ingredients in a small saucepan and bring just to
  the boil. Off heat, allow mixture to cool to room temperature. Liberally
  coat the duck with the mixture and let it sit at room temperature for 3
  hours so that the coating dries out.
  
  To cook: Place duck on a rack, breast side up in a preheated 350 degree
  oven for 2- 2 1/2 hours. Roast until skin is crisp and brown. Check
  occasionally and regulate temperature so that the coating does not burn.
  
  To serve: Let duck cool to room temperature. Carefully carve pieces from
  the bone being sure to include the crisp skin. Roll up in Chinese Pancakes
  (recipe follows) with a dab of hoisin sauce and slivered green onions.
  
  CHINESE PANCAKES
  
  2 cups all-purpose flour 1 cup boiling water 2 tablespoons minced green
  onion 2 tablespoons sesame oil
  
  In a bowl combine the flour and water stirring constantly until all the
  water is absorbed. Add more water if mixture seems dry, dough should just
  hold together in large lumps.
  
  Add green onions and gather and kneed dough on a lightly floured board (or
  in a mixer) until smooth, about 5 minutes. Wrap in plastic and allow to
  rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.
  
  Unwrap, knead again for 5 minutes. Form into a log about 18 inches long and
  1-inch in diameter. Cut roll into 20 pieces and roll each piece into a
  ball. Dip one side of ball in the sesame oil and place oiled side on top of
  another ball. Roll out the two into a circle about 6 inches in diameter.
  (Rolling the two together, helps keep them moist inside.)
  
  Heat an ungreased saute pan over low heat.  Put double pancakes into pan
  and cook until dry on one side. Flip and dry out other side. Remove
  pancakes, peel them apart and set aside. Cover with plastic.
  
  At serving time, steam briefly or wrap in plastic and cook in microwave at
  full power for 30-40 seconds.
