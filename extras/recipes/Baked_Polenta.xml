    <directions>
      <step>    This recipe illustrates an interesting bit of history. Corn came from the
  New World and was taken to Italy. Our beloved cornmeal mush be came known
  as polenta in Italy, and while in Italy Mr. Jefferson learned a new trick.
  He brought this recipe back with him and evidently served it often at the
  plantation.
  
    Bring the water to a boil. Add the salt and slowly stir in the polenta.
  Stir constantly to avoid lumps. After the mixture begins to thicken you can
  stir less frequently. Simmer for about 20 minutes or until very thick. Pour
  into a greased loaf mold or bread pan. Allow to cool in the refrigerator
  overnight.
  
    Cut into 1/4-inch slices and layer like tiles in a baking dish. Pour the
  butter or oil over the top and then the cheese. Bake in 375Ã¸ ovens for
  about 20 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and all begins to brown
  just a bit.
  
  INCLUDES OVERNIGHT CHILLING TIME
