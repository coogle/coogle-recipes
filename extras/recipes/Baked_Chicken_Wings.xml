      <step>  Spread frozen wings on shallow pan in one layer. Bake at 450 degrees for 30
  minutes (or 45 minutes) for large quantities.
  
  Then place in one of sauces, tossing to coat thoroughly:
  
  1.  Butter-Durkee hot sauce mix, which has been posted a couple of times
  (the Anchor Bar's "original way").
  
  2.  2 parts Durkee's redhot sauce, 1 part lemon juice and salad oil (each),
  and, for one quart Durkee's and 1 pint each lemon juice and salad oil, 4
  tsp. dried basil, 2 tsp. powdered onion, and 1 tsp. powdered garlic. Dip
  cooked wings immediately into sauce.
  
  3.  Sweet-sour Apricot Sauce:  Blend 1/2 cup Apricot Preserves, 1/4 cup
  Russian dressing, 1 Tbsp. water, and 1 1/2 tsp. dried onion soup mix. (3/4
  cup)  Toss cooked wings immediately.
  
  General tips:  Allow 3/4 cup sauce for 24 wing portions. Use a 9x13x2 pan
  for 24 wings.
