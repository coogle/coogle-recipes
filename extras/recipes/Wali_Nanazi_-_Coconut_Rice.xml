      <step>  If using a fresh coconut, you will need a hammer and a long nail. Hammer
  the nail into the coconut into the three soft spots on top, going all the
  way through meat to liquid in center. Pour liquid into bowl and reserve.
  Use hammer to crack coconut in half. Place coconut halves in 250 degree
  oven and bake 15-20 minutes (this separates meat from shell). Remove meat
  from shell; cut into chunks and grate, using grater or food processor.
  
  To make coconut milk: Place shredded coconut in food processor or blender.
  Add 2 1/4 cups water and process for 30 seconds. Strain coconut milk
  through sieve or piece of cheese cloth into bowl, containing coconut
  liquid. Squeeze or press coconut pulp to remove all moisture. Repeat
  process using same pulp and 2 1/4 cups more water.
  
  Prepare rice using coconut milk for water.
