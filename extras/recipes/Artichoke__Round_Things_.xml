    <directions>
      <step>  Drain artichokes and reserve oil. finely chop artichokes. mix in cheese.
  add bread crumbs and reserved oil until mix reaches firm enough consistency
  to roll into round things about an inch across. Roll in parmesan cheese and
  place in refrigerator until ready to serve.
  
  NOTE:  I have substituted canned artichokes and concentrated chicken broth
  made from crystals for the jar variety and oil.  You just have to season
  them with garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper.
