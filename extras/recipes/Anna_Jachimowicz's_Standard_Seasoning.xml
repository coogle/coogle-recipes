      <step>   One standard seasoning Mrs. Jachimowicz uses is fried onions. She usually
  makes a large quantity at once so she can add it to each dish without
  preparing it each time. After finely chopping the onions, she browns them
  with a little flour in vegetable oil. When they are golden, she melts some
  butter in the pan. The oil prevents the onions from burning and the butter
  is added for flavor. She also seasons most of her foods with seasoned salt,
  celery salt or savory.
