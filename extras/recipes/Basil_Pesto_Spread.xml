  nuts, and salt to taste in a blender. Process until finely textured but not

  using immediately, pour a thin layer of extra-irgin olie oil over the top.
  Wrap tightly and refrigerate until needed. Makes about 1 cup.
  
  Fresh basil pesto led the revolution in authentic Italian cooking in
  America. It wasn't red and it didn't cook for hours on the stove. In fact,
  it was green! And you didn't have to cook it at all! The fragrant green
  leaves, crushed with garlic and pine nuts, when tossed with freshly cooked
  pasta, creates a dish of unforgettale aroma and taste. Aromatic pesto can
  be used as a spread for panini with equally memorable effect. The following
  recipe produces a dense mixture specifically for panini; to use with pasta,
  just add a little more olive oil and thin with some hot pasta cooking
  water. Format Norma Wrenn npxr56b
