      <step>  I'll start from scratch. Skip down if you're a good bean cooker. (I don't
  use a pressure cooker anymore since I exploded one in cooking beans.). Soak
  beans overnight. Next morning drain off the old water and put in fresh
  water to cover and cook slowly for a couple of hours or until the beans are
  tender. For black beans throw in a LOT of garlic. I use about 1/4 cup
  chopped garlic. (It's easier to use the pre-chopped garlic in the jar if
  you don't mind the oil it's in). Put the garlic in while the beans are
  cooking. After they are cooked put in the salt. (to taste).
  
  some dishes are beans and cornbread, topped with picante sauce, chili with
  black beans (and lots of the black bean juice), Moors &amp; Christains--make
  white rice with pepper strips and onion strips and just about 10 minutes
  before the rice is done throw in some drained black beans, Chalupas--puree
  the beans and cook in a frying pan with some oil,more garlic, and some
  picante sauce. Spread mixture on tortillas and bake in the oven at 350
  degrees. Tortillas are crispy after about 20 minutes if you want them
  open-faced. If you want soft tacos, take them out after about 10-15
  minutes. Top with shredded lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese, sour cream,
  cilantro and more picante sauce.
  
  Black bean enchiladas--roll up black beans, onion, tomato, shredded cheese
  in tortillas. Make a sauce of oil, cumin, chile powder, garlic and
  cornmeal. Stir in oil for awhile till roasted and then pour in water or
  tomato juice (like you're making gravy). When it very first starts getting
  thick, pour over the tortillas and bake 350 degrees 20 min.
  
  Casserole: Make rice with whatever vegetables you have (carrots, celery,
  peppers, onions, garlic). About 5 minutes before the rice is done throw in
  some drained black beans.
  
  You can also probably make something pretty tasty using phyllo leaves
  (strudel leaves) from the grocery store, but I don't have a recipe for it.
  Probably whole black beans, spinach, and cream cheese and fold the phyllo
  into little triangles like you're folding a flag and bake 350 for about 25
  minutes. I haven't tried todo this one, but I like using phyllo leaves.
  
  Pretty much the black beans can be used in anythng remotely latinamerican.
  Use lots of garlic--there's no such thing as too much garlic. Enjoy and
  tell me if you have any other recommendations.
