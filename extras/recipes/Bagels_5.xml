      <step>  Combine yeast and 1/2 c warm water in measuring cup, stirring with a fork
  until dissolved. Combine 2 c flour, salt, and sugar in bowl. Add dissolved
  yeast and remaining 1 c of warm water. Beat vigorously with whisk or spoon
  for 2 minutes. Gradually add enough of remaining flour, 1/4 c at a time, to
  make a soft dough. Turn out of bowl. Knead until smooth and elastic, adding
  as little flour as necessary, about 8-10 minutes. (don't skimp on the
  kneading!) Place dough in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, put in warm
  place to rise until doubled in size. (45-60 minutes. Watch carefully.)
  
  Punch down dough and divide into 12 equal portions (about 3-4 oz each.
  Weigh dough on a kitchen scale for accuracy and even size.) Form into
  smooth balls, gently pulling sides of dough down and tucking ends
  underneath.  Place on floured surface. Let rest 10 minutes.
  
  Using a finger or wooden spoon handle, punch a hole in the center of each
  piece and twirl or stretch into a bagel shape. Cover with a towel and let
  rest 20-30 minutes.
  
  Bring to a boil 6 cups of water, 1 Tbsp sugar and 1 Tbsp salt in a large
  shallow pan. Gently drop 3 or 4 bagels at a time into the simmering water.
  Poach first side 2 minutes, turn to cook other side 2 minutes. Remove
  bagels from water with a slotted spoon and place on a towel to cool.
  
  Over the sink, brush each bagel with egg white wash (1 egg white mixed with
  1 Tbsp water). You may now sprinkle bagel with salt, poppy seeds, minced
  garlic or onion, sesame seeds, whatever suits your fancy. Place bagels on a
  greased baking sheet and bake at 375 degrees for 30 minutes. If you like
  your crust crispy rather than chewy, bake at 375 degrees for 10 minutes,
  then brush on the egg wash and sprinkle with desired topping and return
  bagels to oven for 20 minutes more.
  
  Remove from baking sheet and cool on wire racks.
