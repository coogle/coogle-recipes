    <directions>
      <step>  Ten hours in advance, cook the wine, cinnamon and sugar over a brisk heat
  for 10 minutes, using a broad, shallow saucepan.
  
  Peel the apples and, using a melon-baller of about 2.5 cm (1 in) diameter,
  cut them into little balls.
  
  Throw the apple-balls into the hot wine. They should not overlap: this is
  why you need a broad, shallow pan. Simmer them for 5 to 7 minutes, covered
  with aluminium foil to keep them submerged.
  
  When the apples are cooked but still firm, remove the pan from the stove.
  Let the apple-balls macerate in the red wine for about 10 hours to take on
  a good red colour.
  
  Serving: well chilled, with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream, or in a selection
  of cold fruit desserts.
