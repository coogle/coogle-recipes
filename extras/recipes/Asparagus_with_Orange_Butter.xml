      <step>  In a small saucepan combine orange juice, wine and shallots and bring to a
  boil over medium heat. When liquids have reduced by half, add cream. Bring
  to a boil and reduce heat to very low. Add butter, a few small pieces at a
  time, whisking constantly. Add more butter just as last pieces melt, and
  continue whisking until all butter is added. Season to taste with salt and
  pepper. Set aside in a warm but not hot place. Meanwhile, bring a deep
  saucepan of salted water to a boil. If asparagus are tough, peel stems
  before cooking. For a pretty presentation, line up tips and chop stems to
  same length. Tie asparagus loosely together in two or three bunches with
  two pieces of butchers' twine each. Add asparagus bundles to pot, stem ends
  down, and boil until you can squeeze a piece between your fingers and it is
  tender but not soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain, remove strings and place on a
  serving platter. Drizzle orange sauce over and sprinkle with orange zest.
  This recipe yields 4 servings.
