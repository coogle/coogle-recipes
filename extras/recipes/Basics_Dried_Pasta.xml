      <step>  Basics for new cooks:
  
  In large pot, cover and bring water and salt to full rolling boil. Stir in
  pasta, separating pieces; return to boil and boil, uncovered and stirring
  occasionally, for 8-10 minutes or until tender but firm. Drain well.
  
  Tip: Fine strands and small shapes of dried pasta cook in as little as 3
  minutes.
  
  Tip: If pasta is to be coated with a sauce, do not rinse. The starchy
  coating on pasta aids in holding sauce to the pasta.
