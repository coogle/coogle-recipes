      <step>  Today, I have two picnics just kicking along at about 8 seconds by the palm
  test (225ยบ) to make Eastern NC style pulled pork. They will be ready
  sometime during tonight's poker game. Trying something different on these.
  Normally I only use a little salt and pepper on picnics, butts, and
  shoulders or do them naked. Last night I rubbed one with my salt, molasses
  and pepper cure and the other with Leggs Old Plantation sausage seasoning.
  I don't use any baste or mop. When I pull and chop my pork, I mix in a thin
  infusion sauce in the Eastern NC tradition while the meat is still hot. The
  basic "sauce" (actually sauce is not the right term for something this
  thin) is based on those from Dave Lineback's site:
  
  Preparation: Combine all ingredients and let stand several hours before
  using.
  
  Since I am in the experiment mode, I added 1/2 pint water, 1 tsp celery
  seed, and a dollop (maybe 1 Tbsp) molasses. In deference to former list
  member and keeper of the recipes, Tom Solomon, I also added 1 tsp nuok mam
  to half of this. The Nuok mam actually made a pleasant addition, rounding
  out the flavors nicely.
  
  I will keep enough in the refrigerator to last for about two weeks and
  freeze the rest.
