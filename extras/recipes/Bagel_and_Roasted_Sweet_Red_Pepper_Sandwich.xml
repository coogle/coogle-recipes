      <step>  One of my favorite lowfat quick lunches is a sandwich made of:
  
  I found these terrific roasted red peppers in a jar in a grocery store I
  was sauntering through during my travels one day. The brand name is Roland
  and they say Italian Style Fire Roasted Peppers. The ingredients are
  peppers, water, salt, ascorbic acid. They have a little bit of blackened
  skin so they are tastier than the usual jarred ones. I've found other
  brands that are like these, also, usually at specialty markets or larger
  groceries.
  
  Of course, you can roast your own, too.
  
  There are alot of calories in the bagels and this is extremely filling, so
  you might want to have a half of a sandwich. Use as many pepper slices as
  you can fit on the sandwich - there are only about 10-20 calories per slice
  (depending on how big the pieces are) and no fat. If you want, add sliced
  onions, cukes or other vegetables - whatever you can fit. If packing for
  lunch, wrap securely in waxed paper and/or a zip lock bag to keep the
  moisture from dripping out. Take a big napkin! ENJOY!!
