      <step>  Here's the recipe for the Alaskan Rock Fish that I fixed for Hank's
  birthday. It's a very tender, mild white fish. I fried the fillets just
  like we do on Friday nights at our fish fry. The rock fish almost fell
  apart just turning them in the pan. Anyway, here's what I did. I floured
  the fillets. In a hot skillet, I melted about 1/2 stick of butter and 1/4
  cup of olive oil (I use the Extra Virgin). Then I added a large clove
  garlic (minced) and about 1 tablespoon of fresh ginger (minced) and fried
  the fish for about 2-3 minutes (just until golden), turned it and seasoned
  (freshly ground sea salt and freshly ground black pepper). When the fish
  was golden on the 2nd side, I added the juice of 1 lime and served
  immediately. We didn't use any additional sauce (just the pan sauce) and it
  was really great! It's such a mild fish, I probably over did it with the
  garlic and ginger, but since I really like those flavors, it tasted great
  to me. Me ke aloha, Mary
