    <directions>
      <step>  *     You can substitute 1/2 Cup of Dry Bread Crumbs or 1/2 Cup of Wheat
  **    You can use catsup, chili sauce or barbecue sauce as a topping in
  Heat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Mix all the ingredients except the catsup
  together.  Spread the meat mixture into an ungreased loaf pan, 9 X 5 X
  3-inches or shape into a loaf in an ungreased baking pan.  Spoon catsup
  onto the loaf and bake, uncovered, for 1 to 1 1/4 hours or until done.
  Drain off the excess fat and serve sliced on a heated platter.
  NOTE:
  For leftover meat loaf, try the following:
  BARBECUED MEAT LOAF:
  For four 1/2-inch slices of meat loaf, mix 1/2 cup of barbecue sauce and 2
  tb of water in a skillet.  Place the slices of meatloaf in the skillet,
  turning to coat all sides with the barbecue sauce.  Cover and cook over
  low heat, brushing the sauce on the slices occasionally, until the meat is
  hot, about 10 to 15 minutes.
  POTATO-TOPPED MEAT LOAF:
  For four 1/2-inch slices of meat loaf, prepare some instant mashed
  potatoes, enough for 4 servings, as directed on the package and set aside.
   Set the oven control at broil/or 550 degrees F.  Broil the slices with
  the tops 3 to 4 inches from the heat for 5 minutes.  Spread the potatoes
  on the slices and sprinkle with shredded Cheddar cheese.  Broil until the
  cheese is melted, about 2 minutes and serve hot.
  SOUPED-UP MEAT LOAF:
  For four 1/2-inch slices of meat loaf, mix 1/2 to 1 can of your favorite
  condensed cream soup, such as cream of mushroom, (10 3/4 oz size) and 1/4
  to 1/2 cup of milk in a skillet.  Heat to boiling, stirring frequently.
  Reduce the heat and place the slices in the skilled, turning to coat all
  sides with the sauce.  Cover and simmer until the meat is hot, 10 to 15
  minutes and serve.
