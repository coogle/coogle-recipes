      <step>  Mix 4-5 tablespoons Adobo de Chjle Ancho with 1 1/2 tablespoons of balsamic
  vinegar and 1 tablespoon of brown sugar. Use this to marinate 4 salmon
  fillets (you can also choose sea bass, mahimahi or snapper) for a few
  minutes, then lay on a baking sheet and set about 6 inches below a hot
  broiler. After about 4 minutes, flip them over, drizzle on any marinade
  left in the bowl and broil a few more minutes, until the fish flakes under
  firm pressure.
