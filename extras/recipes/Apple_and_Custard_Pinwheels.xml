  These are a bit like Danish Pastries but without the yeast dough. You can
  use either filling or both together. Cut pastry into 16 squares, 3" by 3".
  On each square, cut in diagonally from each corner, leaving an area in the
  centre that is uncut, about 1 inch across. Put a teaspoonful of either or
  both fillings in the centre. Take one corner and fold it to the middle.
  Move to the next triangle, and fold in one corner. Do this for each of the
  4 triangles, so you have a pinwheel shape. Four corners meet in the middle
  on top of the apple, and 4 are left flat. This is easier to do than to
  explain! Use a fish slice to lift onto a greased or lined tray, and paint
  with milk or egg and milk if you have any. Bake at 190 C, 375 F for 20
  minutes until the points are golden brown. To make custard: Mix all
  together and either microwave for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally, or cook
  over a low heat in a saucepan until thickened. It will taste a bit raw at
  this stage, but will be fine after baking.
