      <step>  If using fresh Masa, set aside. If using Masa Harina, place it in a large
  bowl and reconstitute by adding 4 cups warm stock. Beat with a wooden spoon
  or mix with your hands until you have a stiff, smooth dough like a
  medium-pliable bread dough. Use a little more stock if necessary, but the
  mixture should not be loose. Beat the lard in a large bowl with an electric
  mixer on medium speed until very fluffy and fully aerated, about 3 minutes.
  It may take longer if your mixer is not powerful (a heavy-duty machine such
  as a Kitchen Aid is best). The best alternative to a mixer is not a spoon
  but your bare hand; whip and beat the lard with a rapid folding motion
  until you feel it lightening, and continue to whip until it is fluffy and
  full of air. It should be as light as butter creamed for the lightest
  butter cake. Still mixing on medium speed, begin adding the Masa, a handful
  at a time. Stop to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula
  as necessary. Alternatively, beat in the Masa using your bare ha nd as a
  whipping and folding tool. If the mixture becomes too stiff to beat, add up
  to 1 cup tepid chicken or pork stock, a little at a time. When all the Masa
  has been incorporated, the mixture should be very light and delicate, the
  texture of buttercream frosting. Beat in the salt. The mixture is now ready
  to be spread onto corn husks, banana leaves, or other wrappers and steamed
