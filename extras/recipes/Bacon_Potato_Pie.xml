    <directions>
      <step>  Cut the bacon slices into square pieces. Fry the pieces until well-cooked,
  then drain on paper towels.
  
  Peel the potatoes, then grate them. To prevent the grated potatoes from
  discoloring while you prepare the other ingredients, you can put them into
  a bowl of cold water. When you're ready to use them, be sure to drain well
  and squeeze them dry.
  
  Grate the cheese. Mince the onion. Butter a 9x13 inch shallow baking dish.
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
  
  Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Add all the other ingredients and stir. Pour
  the mixture into the baking dish and bake in the preheated oven for about
  45 minutes, or until the eggs are cooked. Serve hot, warm or at room
  temperature.
  
  NOTES:
  
  * A brunch casserole with potatoes, eggs, bacon and cheese -- This is a
  very easy brunch dish, similar to a fritatta in texture, but full of
  traditional breakfast ingredients. The recipe comes from a cookbook
  published by the _Contra Costa (California) Times_ newspaper, called
  "Tastes of the Times." Yield: Serves 4-6.
  
  * It really does make a difference if you use good meaty bacon for this. I
  find the best bacon at my local butcher shop.
  
  * You can prepare part of this ahead. I think egg dishes are better if they
  haven't been refrigerated. So if you want to work ahead, you can cook the
  bacon, grate the cheese and potatoes and mince the onion the night before.
  Store all these things separately in the refrigerator, covering the
  potatoes with water. Then in the morning just mix it all up and bake it.
  
  : Difficulty: moderate (tedious). : Time: 30 minutes preparation, 1 hour
  baking and cooling. : Precision: approximate measurement OK.
