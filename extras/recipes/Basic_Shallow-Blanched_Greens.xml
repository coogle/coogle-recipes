    <directions>
      <step>  Bring 2 quarts water to boil in soup kettle or large, deep saute pan. Add
  salt and greens-, stir until wilted. Cover and cook until greens are just
  tender, about 7 minutes, drain in colander. Rinse kettle or pan with cold
  water to cool, then refill with cold water. Pour greens into cold water to
  stop cooking process. Gather handful of greens, lift out of water, and
  squeeze until only droplets fall from them. Repeat with remaining greens.
  Roughly cut each bunch of greens. Proceed with one of the compatible
  recipes.
