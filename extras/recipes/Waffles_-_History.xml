      <step>  Waffles are as American as apple pie, and like apple pie are an import. The
  word "waffle" and probably the food, comes to us from the Dutch "wafel",
  but the French eat them too, calling them "gaufre" from the Old French
  "wafla".  Whatever their provenance, waffles have been eaten by Americans
  since Pilgrim times.
  
  Europeans eat their waffles as a sweet course, topping them with powdered
  sugar, whipped cream, or honey or stuffing them with icing. Americans have
  occasionally served waffles for dessert - perhaps a chocolate waffle with
  ice cream - but in general we eat them for breakfast with all-American
  maple syrup.  At least NOW we do, if we eat waffles at all.
  
  But in the Thirties, and before that, Americans ate waffles with virtually
  anything that could be spooned or poured over their bumpy, golden tops. And
  we ate them for breakfast, for luncheon, and for supper. If we served them
  to guests at a Sunday Night Supper, it became a waffle supper, "sure to be
  a party guests remember," according to the General Foods cookbook "All
  About Home Baking" (1933).
  
  And we made waffles with just about everything:  Cheese waffles; cornmeal
  waffles; coconut, pineapple, and chocolate waffles; gingerbread waffles;
  banana waffles; cheese and tomato, date, and peanut butter waffles; apple
  waffles; oatmeal waffles; and prune, bran, apricot, and even pea pulp
  waffles (which Pictorial Review featured as one of their best recipes for
  1927.)
