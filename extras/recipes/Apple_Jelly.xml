    <directions>
      <step>  To prepare juice:  Select about one-fourth firm-ripe and three-fourths
  fully ripe tart apples.  Sort, wash, and remove stem and blossom ends; do
  not pare or core. Cut apples into small pieces. Add water, cover and bring
  to boil on high heat.  Reduce heat and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, or
  until apples are soft. Extract juice.
  
  To make jelly:  Measure apple juice into a kettle. Add lemon juice and
  sugar nd stir well.  Boil over high heat to 8 degrees above the boiling
  point of water, or until jelly mixture sheets from a spoon.
  
  Remove from heat, skim off foam quickly.  Pour jelly immediately into
  sterilized hot containers and seal. Makes 3 to 4 eight ounce glasses.
