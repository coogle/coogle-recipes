      <step>   This recipe contains no carbonation and no ice cream.  I have not tried it
  spiked, but you could probably add rum to it (I'm not up on alcohol, but I
  believe that's supposed to be good in punch). This is our family's punch
  recipe--we serve it for all special occasions.
  
   I will give what I think are the proportions first, then I'll give the
  exact amounts my mother-in-law uses for the 11 people in our extended
  family.
  
   *Sorry, I don't know the size of the "tall can", but it's the standard
  U.S. size that is larger than the 12-oz.-can size.
  
   Prepare lemonade.  Reconstitute orange juice, pineapple juice,and
  grapefruit juice, according to package directions, and in separate
  containers. Add lemonade to punch bowl. Add all of the orange juice, 1/2
  (up to 3/4) of the pineapple juice, and 1/2 of the grapefruit juice.
  
   Slice thin orange wheels and float on top for a festive look.  Cherries
  would also look nice.
