  Basic Ingredients for *any* of the recipes* 3/4 cup whole &amp; unblanched
  almonds 1/4 pound butter 3/4 cup sugar 2 eggs 2 1/4 cup flour 1 1/2
  tsp. baking powder 1/4 tsp. salt
  
  For Orange Biscotti Zest from 1 orange, grated or minced 2 Tbls.
  orange liqueur, or 1 Tbls. orange extract 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon
  
  For Anise Biscotti 2 - 3 tsp. crushed anise seeds
  
  For Lemon Biscotti Zest from 1 lemon, grated or minced 1 Tbls. lemon
  extract, or 1 Tbls. lemon juice
  Procedures for all recipes Toast the almonds until golden, then chop
  by hand into 1/4 inch chunks. *Reduce oven heat to *325* degrees*
  Cream the butter until light, add the sugar &amp; beat till smooth &amp;
  creamy. Beat in eggs until the mixture is smooth. Add the (orange,
  anise, lemon) specific ingredients. Sift in the flour, baking powder
  &amp; salt, beat until just mixed. Stir in the almonds. On a floured
  board, divide the dough in half &amp; roll each half into a long roll
  about 1 1/2 inches in diameter &amp; about 10 inches long. Set the rolls
  on a baking sheet at least 3 inches apart, bake in the top third of
  the oven (*325*) for about 25 minutes, or until they are set &amp;
  lightly browned on top. Cool the rolls for 5 minutes or so, then
  slice diagonally into 1/2 inch thick slices. Lay the slices flat on
  the baking sheet &amp; return to the oven for another 10 minutes. Turn
  the slices over &amp; bake for another 10 minutes. Cool on a rack, and
  keep in a tightly covered tin - they keep for months.
