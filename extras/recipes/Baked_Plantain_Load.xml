    <directions>
      <step>  Peel the plantains, cut them into small chunks &amp; put into a large deep
  mixing bowel. Mash into a thick paste with your fingers or an electric
  clender. If using a blender, you may need to add 30-60 ml of water for
  smoother blending. Add the chilli sambal, rice flour, salt and mix
  well. Gently heat the corn oil in a frying pan and add the turmeric.
  Stir well, remove from the heat and blend into the plantain mixture
  which should be thinck yet soft enough to pour. If it is too soft,
  add small amounts of rice flour or if too stiff, add small amounts of
  water until it reached th described consistency.
  
  Grease a loaf tin, and pour plantain mixture into it. Bake in teh
  overn on medium to low heat at 150-180C for 1 hr. or until cooked and
  firm. When cooked, remove from the overn and allow to stand for
  approximately 5-10 mins before turning it out on a wire rack. Slice
  and serve with salted peanuts or as an accompaniment to spicy dishes.
