    <directions>
      <step>  To plump Raisins: Put raisins in boiling water and let sit 15 minutes, then
  drain.
  
  Mix together in a large bowl the raisins, nuts, apples, sugar, lemon juice,
  zest and spices. Have the butter and bread crumbs ready. Preheat the oven
  to 400 degrees.
  
  Spread a towel or a couple of sheets of waxed paper on a counter. Working
  quickly to keep the phyllo from drying out and keeping the remaining sheets
  covered with a damp towel, place one sheet at the towel long side across.
  Quickly brush it with some of the melted butter, stroking in one direction
  to minimize inevitable tears. Place the second sheet about an inch below
  the first, and brush it with more butter. Continue to overlap the sheets of
  phyllo, brushing each with butter, to make a rectangle about 22 x 14
  inches.
  
  Scatter the bread crumbs over the phyllo, leaving a 3-inch border all
  around. Spread the apple mixture evenly over the bread crumbs. Fold over
  the border of two short sides on top of the filling, then fold over the
  longer sides. Lifting the towel to help you, roll up the filling along the
  long side to make a bundle about 16 x 4 x 2 inches. With spatulas, transfer
  it seam-side down to a buttered baking sheet or jelly-roll pan. Brush the
  top and ends with the remaining butter and bake until golden brown, 25 to
  30 minutes. Let it cool somewhat on the sheet. Dust the strudel with
  confectioners' sugar, and serve still warm with lightly sweetened whipped
  cream.
  
  NOTES : Ready-made phyllo sheets, although not authentic, substitute well
  for strudel dough and make the traditional Austrian desert possible without
  a long day's labor.  Have all the filling ingredients ready before you take
  out the phyllo, and take care to keep the sheets from drying by covering
  them with damp cloths.
