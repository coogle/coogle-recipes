    <directions>
      <step>  1. Bring water to boil in a large pot. Stir in rice, oil or butter, and
  salt. Simmer briskly, uncovered, until rice is almost tender, about 30
  minutes.
  
  2. Drain rice into a steamer basket that fits inside the pot. Fill pot with
  about 1 inch water and return to heat. Place basket of rice in pot-
  
  cover and steam until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Scoop rice into a bowl and
  fluff gently with a fork.
  
  Rice Cooker Variation: Stir 2 1/4 cups water, 1 cup brown rice, 1 teaspoon
  oil or butter, and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in the cooking chamber of a
  rice cooker. Cover, and cook according to manufacturer's directions. If
  rice remains too crunchy for your taste, add several tablespoons water and
  restart cooking. Machine will automatically shut off when additional water
  has been absorbed.
