      <step>  This is a fourth generation handed down receipe. We call it Aunt Clara's
  Fruit Salad because my Great-Great Aunt Clara used to bring this to family
  functions.
  
  *NOTE: - whatever is in season at the time. I usually put in two large
  bunches of green grapes, 4 large apples and 4 larger bananas plus whatever
  else I have on hand.
  
  Drain juice from pineapple into 2 qt saucepan and heat juice until hot;
  wisk in vinegar/lemon juice and coarnstarch until smooth and very thick
  (like pudding.) Cool mixture. Put fruit (cut up in bite sized pieces) into
  serving bowl/container, add marshmellows and whipped cream/Cool Whip and
  gently stir to coat. Refrigerate until serving time. (Can coat apple and
  banana pieces in a little of the lemon juice to keep them from turning
  brown.)
  
  Note: This is my daughters' favorite salad which I am 'required' to bring
  to all family functions such as Christmas and Easter get-togethers. It can
  make a large salad if you add lots of fruit - if I need a larger salad, I
  usually use a larger container of Cool Whip.
