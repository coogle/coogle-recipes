      <step>    This same recipe can be used to make apple, grape, peach, pear or plum
  butters.  In general use 1 cup fruit pulp to 1/2 cup sugar. Spice to taste
  and cook slowly. To make apple butter, use tart cooking apples, not the
  sweet eating varieties. If sweet apples are all you have to use, reduce the
  sugar by 1/3 to 1/2.
     Wash, quarter and core the unpeeled fruit.  Place in a heavy kettle with
  just enough water to prevent scorching. Cook until soft, stirring
  frequently,  and press through a food mill. Mix ingredients in a heavy
  kettle and cook over low heat, stirring frequently, until thick. When
  ready, a spoonful put on a plate should hold its shape and not 'weep'
  liquid around the edges of the mound after sitting for five minutes. This
  usually takes about two hours of cooking but can take as long as four, so
  plan this project for a day when you have other things to do in the
  kitchen. Don't try and hurry the process as the mixture can easily burn and
  burned apple butter is only good for the compost pile. Stir frequently, and
  if possible use a 'heat difuser' between the burner and the kettle.
    Oven Method:  Cook the fruit butter in a roasting pan in a 250 - 300 F.
  oven until thick;  may take 6 to 8 hours. Stir occasionally. It needs less
  stirring this way but uses take much more energy and can be awkward to
  stir.
    Crockpot Method:  Put ingredients in crockpot and cook, uncovered, for
  about 12 hours, stirring occasionally, until it passes the test given
  above.
     When finished, pack into jars per standard canning methods and process
  pints 5 minutes or quarts 10 minutes in a boiling water bath. Adapted from
