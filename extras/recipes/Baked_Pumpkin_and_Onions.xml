      <step>    I can't give the amounts on this one. It's much too simple for that. It's
  just an old-fashioned way of serving the great American squash. Make as
  little or as much as you like. Your kids will love it.
  
    Clean and peel some pumpkin and cut it into thick slices. Arrange them in
  a buttered baking dish and add sliced onions. Add salt and pepper and a bit
  of melted butter or olive oil. Repeat with another layer and top with a few
  spoons of brown sugar.
  
    Bake, uncovered, at 350Ã¸ until tender, about 30 minutes. You may wish to
  cook it longer.
  
    I generally serve this as a vegetable dish.
