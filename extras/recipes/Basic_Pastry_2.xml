    <directions>
      <step>  1.  Measure flour and place in a large bowl.  Cut cold shortening into 1"
  cubes and add to flour.  Using a pastry blender or 2 knives, cut shortening
  into flour until it is the consistency of coarse meal. Make a well in
  centre.
  
  2.  Place egg and vinegar in a measuring cup.  Add ice water to bring it up
  to 1 cup.  Whisk to break up egg and blend with water. Add liquid to flour
  mixture all at once. Then, using a fork, work until all dry ingredients are
  moist.  Using your hands, gather dough into a firm ball. Do not over- mix
  or knead dough. Cut dough into 4 equal pieces.
  
  3.  Wrap each piece of dough individually and refrigerate until well
  chilled, at least 30 minutes but preferably overnight. Well-wrapped pastry
  will keep well inthe refrigerator for a least a week or in the freezer for
  several months.
