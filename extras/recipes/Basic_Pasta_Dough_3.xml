    <directions>
      <step>  In a large bowl mix the flour and salt. Make a well in center of flour. Add
  eggs, one at a time, mixing slightly after each addition. Add gradually the
  water and oil. Mix well to make a stiff dough. Turn dough onto a lightly
  floured surface and knead for 3 to 5 minutes until smooth and elastic.
  Divide dough into fourths. Lightly roll each portion 1/8" thick and cut
  lengthwise into 5" wide strips. Use the strips immediately, do not allow to
  dry. Place 2 teaspoons of whatever filling you are using 1 1/2 " from the
  narrow end and in the center of the strip. Continue along the strip,
  placing the filling at 3" intervals. Fold the strip in half lengthwise,
  covering the mounds of filling. To seal, press the edges together with the
  tines of a fork. Press gently between the mounds to form rectangles 3"
  long. Cut apart with a pastry cutter and press the cut edges with the tines
  of a fork to seal. Let the ravioli dry for about 2 hrs. Then in a large
  saucepan bring to a boil: 7 quarts water with 2 Tb salt. Gradually add the
  ravioli. Boil rapidly, uncovered, about 10 min or until tender. Remove with
  a slotted spoon and drain. Place on a warm platter and top with a sauce.
