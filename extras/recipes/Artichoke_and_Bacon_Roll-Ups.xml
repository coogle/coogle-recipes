    <directions>
      <step>  Cut package of bacon slices in halves or thirds crosswise to make shorter
  strips. Cut artichoke hearts in half. Wrap each piece of artichoke heart
  with a bacon strip and fasten with a toothpick. Spray a broiler pan (like
  the two-piece one that came with your stove) with Pam and arrage appetizers
  on it, not touching if possible. Up to this point recipe can be done ahead,
  wrapped in foil, and refrigerated if it has to wait more than 2 hours.
  
  15 minutes before serving time, sprinkle brown sugar over the top and bake
  in a 350 F. oven until bacon is crisped to your taste. Serve on a plate
  lined with paper napkins, or if on a buffet put in warmer lined with paper
  towels or a rack.

  NOTES : Make plenty of these, as they disappear like snowballs on a hot
  stove, but NOT if a meal is to follow as they are quite filling.
