      <step>  Prepare a medium-hot charcoal fire.
  
  Cut the middle portion of the round loaf into 6 long slices, each one
  almost an inch thick. Cut these slices in half, making half-slices that are
  roughly 3x3x1 inches.
  
  When fire is ready, place the 12 slices over it in a single layer. Cook,
  turning once, until the outsides of the bread are golden brown (with grill
  marks, if possible). This should take about 2 minutes per side-but check
  frequently to make sure the bread isn't burning.
  
  When the bread slices are done, rub the edges of each one, on both sides,
  with a cut clove of garlic-lightly or heavily, depending on your garlic
  preference. Place the slices on a large platter in a single layer. Sprinkle
  each slice with 2 teaspoons of olive oil, breaking the surface of the bread
  lightly with a spoon to let the oil soak in. Season with salt and pepper.
  Turn the slices over and repeat the procedure. Let the slices sit in the
  olive oil for 10-15 minutes. Serve as is for simple bruschetta.
