    <directions>
      <step>  Mix milk, butter, sugar, yeast together and put in the mixer bowl. Let sit
  till yeast proofs. Add eggs, salt then flour. Add slowly and at low speed
  or more flour will be on you and your cabinets then in the bread. Add
  enough to make the dough glossy ,but not too sticky. Let rest for 5 min.
  ~Leave dough in mixer- Then knead[ adding flour as needed] again for 1-3
  minutes at setting 3or4. Put bowl in warm area until doubles, punch down
  good an knead it a bit, Let it double again. Punch down and put onto a
  floured table ( lightly). Knead -ading flour to dough as needed) form into
  2 loaves or rolls. Bake at 350-f for an Hour. Knock on the loafe it will
  sound hollow.
  
  &gt;From this you can just about do anything. Add a cup of leftover cereal or
  a combination of such use Molasses for sugar and you have Anadama Bread.
  Add 1/2 cup of Chopped tomatoes and 1 tsp. of oregano, basil you've got
  Tomato Herb bread. A nice change from garlic bread for Spaghetti.
  
  The trick togood bread making is the flour and kneading. Any "wet" addtion
  to recipe will need a increase of flour. Kneading- flour should be added
  but only enough to make the dough resilent to touch. Experiment it's FUN!
