      <step>  A quintessential New Orleans dessert, and a favorite among most locals.
  This dish cannot be prepared in the kitchen. It must be performed, in front
  of your guests. Use a chafing dish, and some kind of portable heat like
  Sterno. Don't be sloppy, and keep a fire extinguisher handy. There's no
  need to burn the house down just for dessert, but this really must be done
  right. I learned to cook this dish from Chef Joe Cahn at the New Orleans
  School of Cooking, and he spun dire tales of what befell those who dared
  sequester themselves in the kitchen when making Bananas Foster. Seriously,
  bad gris-gris will befall you if you deprive your guests of the spectacle.
  Plus, they'll talk for years about how cool you are to have made this for
  their dessert.
  
  First, you should make some preparations. Peel a thin strip of peel from
  the bananas, and use your knife to slice the banana crossways into coins.
  Then replace the banana peel so that it looks untouched (as best as you
  can, anyway). This way, you can pretend to "peel" your bananas, and dump
  them into the put already cut, as if by magic. Cheesy, you ask? Well, it
  still looks cool, particularly if you're really nonchalant when you do this
  in front of your guests. If you insist, you can slice the bananas the
  classical way, quartering them by slicing thm lengthwise and then in half.
  I still think the other way is cooler.
  
  Put your ground cinnamon into some kind of non-standard container, or even
  a little muslin bag, the better to "convince" your guests that it is, in
  fact, not cinnamon but voodoo dust, scraped from the tomb of Marie Laveau
  at midnight on All Soul's Day ... some kind of delightfully corny crap like
  that. Also, I recommend taking a cinnamon stick and grinding it fresh in a
  spice or coffee grinder instead of using pre-ground cinnamon. Sieve the
  result through a tea ball strainer to remove the larger pieces which won't
  grind finely. This will maximize the fresh, aromatic cinnamon flavor. If
  you use your coffee grinder, it'll also make your coffee taste great.
  
  Now, to business ...
  
  Melt the butter and add the brown sugar to form a creamy paste. Let this
  mixture caramelize over the heat for about 5 minutes. Stir in the banana
  liqueur and rum. Heat until the liquor is warmed, about three minutes. Add
  the bananas, cook for about 1 - 2 minutes, then ignite with a flourish.
  Here's the best way to do this:
  
  Using a long, bent-handled ladle, scoop up some of the warm liquor. Hold it
  a foot or two above the chafing dish and ignite the liquor in the ladle.
  VERY CAREFULLY, pour the liquor into the dish. A column of flame will
  descend from the ladle into the dish, which will ignite with a marvelous
  *poof*! Keep a pal nearby, subtly wielding a fire extinguisher. Try not to
  become a human torch in the process.
  
  Agitate to keep the flame burning, and add a few pinches of "voodoo dust"
  to the flame. The cinnamon will sparkle orange in the blue flame, and looks
  really neat.
  
  Let the flames go out. Serve over ice cream if you wish, but some hardcores
  like me like it just like it is. Yum.
  
  Variations: one may substitute any fruit for this dish that has a
  correspondingly flavored liqueur -- peaches, pears, whatever. Walt MM
