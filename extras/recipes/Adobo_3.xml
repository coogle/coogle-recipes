      <step>   Toasting the chiles and garlic. Roast the garlic cloves on a griddle or
  heavy skillet over medium heat, turning frequently, until blackened in
  spots and VERY soft, about 15 minutes. Remove, cool, skin and roughly chop.
   While the garlic is roasting, tear the chiles into flat pieces and toast
  them a few at a time: Use a metal spatula to press them firmly against the
  hot surface for a few seconds, until they blister, crackle and change
  color, then flip them over and press them flat to toast the other side.
   Soaking the dried chiles. Break the chiles into a small bowl, cover with
  boiling water, weight with a plate to keep submerged and soak 30 minutes.
  Drain, tear into smaller pieces, place in a blender jar and add the garlic.
   Finishing the Adobo. In a mortar or spice grinder, pulverize the cinnamon,
  cloves, peppercorns, bay leaves and cumin. Add the chiles along with the
  oregano, thyme, salt, vinegar and 3 Tb water. With a long series of blender
  pulses, reduce the mixture to a paste. Run the blender for a few seconds
  until the mixture clogs, then scrape down the sides with a spatula and
  stir; repeat a dozen times or more until the mixture is smooth. Don't add
  water unless absolutely necessary or this marinating paste won't do its job
  well. Strain the paste through a medium-mesh sieve into a noncorrosive
  container with a tight-fitting lid. Cover and refrigerate.
   Considerations: After soaking the chiles, they can be put through a foley
  food mill to remove the skins and the seeds. Add this puree along with the
  garlic to the small blender jar and proceed. If this is done, and the
  mixture is put together in a small blender jar, and pulsed, scraped down,
  and mixed very well the final sieving can be eliminated.
   All of the chiles can be Ancho or Guajillo. You can substitute 3 1/2
  ounces of California or New Mexican chiles for the above chiles but the
  flavor will be light.
   Adobo with powdered chiles: For a darker, stronger tasting adobo made
  without the tedious series of blender runs, roast the chiles and garlic as
  directed above, then pulverize the chiles with the cinnamon,cloves,pepper,
  bay leaves and cumin in several batches in a spice grinder; sift through a
  medium-mesh sieve. Skin the garlic and mash it to a smooth paste. Mix with
  the powdered chile mixture, oregano, thyme, salt, vinegar and 6 Tb water.
  Store as directed above.
