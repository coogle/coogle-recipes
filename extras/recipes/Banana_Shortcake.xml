  This Banana Shortcake makes a satisfying, whole breakfast - it's not a
  dessert shortcake.  Because the Banana Bread is made in advance - and
  probably frozen ~ the shortcake is quick and easy to put together. I
  (Marjorie Hurt Jones) sometimes serve it for "normal eating" house guests
  who devour every last crumb!
  
  Directions:
  
  Mash banana with a fork; whip until light and frothy. If you enjoy a little
  tang, add the lemon juice or the pinch of the vit C. Toast the bread
  lightly either in a toasster oven or in a dry frypan - homemade quickbreads
  don't do well in a traditional pop-up toasster.
  
  To assemble: Lay toasted bread on a plate; top with a dollop of masshed
  banana.
  
  Note:  If your Banana Bread is frozen be sure to take it out the evening
  before you want it for breakfast. Use a serrated bread knife for slicing.
