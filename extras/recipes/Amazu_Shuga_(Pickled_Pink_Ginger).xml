  From: Wendy Lockman &lt;wlockman@ra1.randomc.com&gt;
  Whilst poring over my three volume loose leaf cookbook (inhabited mainly by
  stuff snatched from here) I ran across the following that I though you
  might be interested in. I think that the caveat about fresh, young ginger
  root is necessary to this recipe. I don't think the older, woody stuff
  would work at all. Guess this originally appeared here from the heading...
  
  Using a sharp knife or a Beriner cutter,shave ginger root into paper- thin
  slices. In a small, airtight container, combine vinnegar, sugar and salt.
  Blanch ginger for 30 seconds in boiling water. Drain ginger; cool. If
  desired, reserve liquid for cooking purposes. Add cooled ginger to vinegar
  mixture; mix well. Store marinating ginger in the refrigerator. Pickled
  ginger can be eaten after 24 hours of marinating. It will keep several
  weeks. Good with either Sushi or noodles. Add marinade to salads or sauces.
