  Here's a hard candy recipe that's published in a leaflet, "Guide to Hard
  Candy Making," by Apollo Mold Company.  It's pretty good, though you have
  to be careful to use enough coloring and flavoring!
  
  In a saucepan, blend sugar, corn syrup, and water.  Bring to a boil over
  high heat until mixture reaches 290 degrees Fahrenheit.  Stir frequently
  with a metal (not wood) spoon. Remove pan from heat. Allow to stand until
  bubbles have simmered down. Add flavoring and color, as desired. Too much
  stirring will cause the syrup to solidify into a hard sugary lump. Mold
  into desired shapes in Apollo Hard Candy Molds sprayed lightly with a
  nonstick vegetable oil spray. Work fast. If mixture becomes too cold and
  thick, it may be warmed for a few seconds in a microwave.
  
  When hard candies are completely cooled, store them in airtight containers
  or place them, individually, in 3- by 5-inch plastic sucker bags.
