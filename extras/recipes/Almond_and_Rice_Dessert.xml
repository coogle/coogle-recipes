      <step>  1. Make almond milk: Place blanched almonds in a small bowl, and pour the
  boiling water over them. Cover, and soak for at least 15 minutes. Put the
  almonds with their soaking water in the container of an electric blender,
  and finely puree. Strain the almond milk through a double layer of
  cheesecloth into a small bowl, squeezing the cloth to extract as much
  almond milk as possible. This will yield 2/3 cup.
  
  3. Combine the milk, light cream, and sugar in a heavy bottomed saucepan,
  and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. As the milk comes to a boil,
  reduce the heat. Give the rice and almond milk comes to a boil, reduce the
  heat. Give the rice and almond mixture a stir, because rice flour has a
  tendency to separate from the liquid and settle at the bottom. Add it to
  the milk and cream in the saucepan in a steady, slow stream, stirring
  rapidly with a wire whisk to prevent lumping. Cook over low heat until the
  mixture thickens and a thin custard is formed on the spoon. Continue
  cooking the custard, uncovered, for an additional 5 minutes. The custard
  should be quite thin. As it chills, it will thicken considerably. (If the
  custard should accidentally stick and burn, turn off the heat, and
  immediately pour it into another saucepan. DO NOT SCRAPE OUT THE BURNT
  RESIDUE; it will release the burnt-custard smell and texture into the
  pudding.
  
  4. Cool the custard thoroughly. Check to make sure there are no lumps. If
  there are, pass the custard through a fine sieve. (Do not blend it in the
  electric blender or food processor, or it will become runny.) Stir in the
  rose water, cover, and refrigerate to chill thoroughly. A skin will form on
  the custard. No need for alarm. Simply stir it in with a wire whisk. To
  serve, pour into individual dessert dishes, sprinkle with chopped almonds
  and pistachios, and place a teaspoon of pomegranate or a strawberry in the
  center.
  
  Note: This dessert can be made ahead and refrigerated for up to 4 days. It
  does not freeze well at all.
