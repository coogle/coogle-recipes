    <directions>
      <step>  Preheat the oven to 425deg.. Cut a circle of baker's parchment or waxed
  paper to line the bottom of the cake pan or springform. Butter the bottom
  and sides of the pan, then insert the paper and butter it also. If using
  the springform, wrap the outside of the pan with tinfoil to make it
  watertight. Melt the chocolate and butter in the top of a double boiler
  over gently simmering water. Remove from the heat, whisk until smooth, then
  whisk in the peanut butter and chile purée. In a mixing bowl, beat the eggs
  until they are light and have increased in volume, two to three minutes.
  Carefully fold the eggs into the chocolate mixture in three batches until
  no streaks of egg are visible. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and
  smooth the top. Pour about one inch of hot water into a larger baking pan
  and set the cake pan or springform in it. Place the pans in the middle rack
  of the oven and bake for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and set the torte
  on a rack to cool. Sprinkle the chopped peanuts on the top of the torte,
  pressing very gently so they will adhere. When the torte has cooled, cover
  and refrigerate at least four hours or overnight. To unmold, dip a sharp
  knife into hot water, dry it, and run it around the edge of the torte pan.
  Immerse the base of the pan in hot water for a few seconds, dry it well,
  then turn it out onto a serving plate so that the chopped nuts become the
  crust.
  
  Presentation: I cut a chile pepper stencil out of parchment, place it on
  top, and dust it with powdered sugar or cocoa. Serve plain, with shortbread
  cookies or sweetened whipped cream. Yields eight generous servings Posted
