      <step>       In my attempt to type out the recipes of the Great Chefs books
  series, I've run across some "basic" recipes that run through all of
  the books.  They are the "stock" recipes that are common to all
  cooking, and I'm sure you have these.  But just in case (and for my
  own files) I typed them out anyway.
  
        Here (and in subsequent messages) are the recipes for:
  
  01  Almond Cookie Shells - Great Chefs
  02  Asparagus Sauce - Great Chefs
       03    Aspic Jelly - Great Chefs
