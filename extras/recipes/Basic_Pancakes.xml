      <step>  The recipe calls for 1 T. oil, but you can substitute mashed banana, prune
  puree, applesauce, whatever. I cook these on a non-stick griddle sprayed
  lightly with Pam
  
  Zoe asked for pancake recipes. This is the basic one I've used for many
  years, from the old New York Times Natural Foods Cookbook (which
  unfortunately I no longer have).
  
  Recently I've begun mixing up the dry ingredients in large quantities,
  using a mixture of flours. Last time it was something like 3 c. whole wheat
  flour, 2 c. cornmeal, 1 c. rye flour. Think I'll put in some oatmeal next
  time. Whatever your mixture, for every cup of flour add 1 tsp. soda, 1/2
  tsp. salt, and 1 T. sugar. Then when you get ready to make pancakes, for
  every 1 1/4 c. pancake mix, just add 1 c. buttermilk, 1 egg equivalent, and
  1 T. of your fat substitute. It's nice to have on hand. I store mine in big
  coffee cans, with a bay leaf added to discourage the creepy-crawlies (the
  bay leaf has always worked for me--knock on wood).
