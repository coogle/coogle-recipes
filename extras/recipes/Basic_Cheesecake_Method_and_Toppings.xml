      <step>  Let cream cheese sit out until it's room temperature, nice and soft. Beat
  the cream cheese and sugar together until fluffy.  Add eggs one at a time
  (break them into a separate cup - one teensy bit of shell will ruin
  everything!) and beat just until mixed.  Add remaining ingredients and beat
  just until mixed. Pour into chilled shell and bake at 325 for 50 minutes to
  an hour.
  
  Jam may be melted and poured evenly over the top of the cooled cake.
  
  Fruits may be arranged on top of a cooled cake, then covered with a melted
  jam glaze.
  
  4 oz chocolate or white chocolate chips, melted with 2-3 Tbsp butter and
  maybe 1 -2 Tbsp whipping cream (if desired) can be poured on top of the
  cooled cake.
  
  For a yogurt or sour cream topping, cook the cake only 50 minutes, cool the
  cake 15 minutes, mix together 1 cup yogurt or sour cream with 1/4 cup sugar
  (regular is OK since this is so liquid) and 1 Tbsp vanilla or other
  flavoring (lemon juice, extract, etc.) raise the oven temperature to 475
  and bake another 10 minutes.
