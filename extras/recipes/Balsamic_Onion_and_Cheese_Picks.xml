  Recipe By: The California Culinary Academy
  1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Blanch onions in boiling, salted water 30
  seconds; drain. Slice off the root end. "Peel" the onions by pressing them
  slightly between your fingers; the inner part will slip out of the papery
  skin.
  
  2. Whisk together oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper. Put onions in a roasting
  pan, add oil-vinegar mixture, and toss to coat well. Bake until tender
  (about 25 minutes). Remove from oven and let cool in pan. Taste; adjust
  seasoning as necessary.
  
  3. To serve, place 2 onions and 1 cheese cube on each cocktail skewer.
  Makes 24 to 30 skewers.
  
  NOTES : Tiny pearl onions turn sweet and soft when roasted with oil and
  vinegar, especially a vinegar as mellow and rich as Italian balsamic. The
  onions can be roasted a few days ahead; the cheese can be cubed and wrapped
  in plastic a day in advance. The cheese will cube better if cold, but both
  onions and cheese taste better at room temperature.
