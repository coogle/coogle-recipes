    <directions>
      <step>  Combine in a small bowl the water, salt, yeast, and sugar. Add the
  shortening and let proof.  Sift the flour into a large bowl. Make a well in
  the center and gradually add liquid, stirring constantly. Stir with a
  wooden spoon until the dough starts to leave the sides of the bowl. Turn
  out and knead for 10 minutes. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl and
  cover with a clean tea towel and let rise about 1 1/2 hours. Punch dough
  down and let rise again for 30 to 45 minutes. Punch down and let rest for
  10 minutes. Turn the dough onto a floured board and roll into a 15" x 10"
  oblong.  Roll up tightly toward you, beginning with the wide side. With a
  hand on each end, roll the loaf back and forth to taper the ends and
  lengthen the loaf. Place diagonally on a greased and cornmeal- sprinkled
  cookie sheet. Slash at 2" intervals and let rise uncovered for about 1 1/2
  hours. Place in a 425 F oven.  For the first 15 minutes, spray with a fine
  mist of water every four minutes. Reduce heat to 350 F and bake 20 minutes
  longer.  The loaf should be golden brown and slide off the sheet easily.
