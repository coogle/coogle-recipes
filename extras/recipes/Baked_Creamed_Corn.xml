    I had never tasted this dish, nor had I ever even heard of it, until one
  of my staff in Chicago, Mark Blank, told me about his summer days on his
  grandfather's farm in Indiana. This was one of his favorite dishes and he
  even brought me the device that his grandfather had made for this special
  dish. You need a corn scraper in order to do this properly, and it can be
  done only with fresh corn. I just bought an "original" Lees corn cutter and
  creamer and it seems to work quite well.
  
    When Mark was sitting in a corner of the studio scraping, he said, "You
  know, this won't taste right. You have to have bees flying about your head
  while you scrape corn in the lndiana sun. We have no bees!" The dish is
  quite delicious, nevertheless. You will think that there is actually cream
  in this dish, but there is none.
  
    Scrape the corn from the cob and cream it, using a corn cutter/creamer.
  Place the mixture in a greased baking dish and pour the melted butter on
  top. Bake uncovered at 375Ã¸ for about 30 minutes, or until the top lightly
  browns.
