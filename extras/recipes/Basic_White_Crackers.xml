      <step>  Preheat the oven to 325~ F. 325~ F 20 to 25 minutes In a large bowl or in
  the food processor, combine the flour and salt. Cut the butter into the
  flour until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Slowly mix in enough of the
  milk to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball. If
  necessary, add up to 1 additional Tablespoon of milk. Divide the dough into
  3 equal portions for rolling. On a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll
  the crackers paper thin. They will look almost translucent. If desired,
  lightly sprinkle the tops with salt and gently roll over the dough with
  your rolling pin. With a sharp knife, carefully cut the crackers into
  2-inch squares. Handling them gently, transfer them to an ungreased baking
  sheet. Prick each cracker in 2 or 3 places with the tines of a fork. Bake
  for 20 to 25 minutes, or until lightly browned. Cool on a rack. Yield:
  95-100. VARIATIONS: This basic recipe can be the starting point for much
  interesting experimentation. Simply varying flour or liquid can produce an
  entirely new cracker unavailable anywhere but in your kitchen.
