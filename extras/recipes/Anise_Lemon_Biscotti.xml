      <step>  These recipes were taken from the "Moosewood Restaurant Low-Fat Favorites"
  Cookbook. I haven't made them, so I don't know about their quality, but,
  being from Moosewood, I'd count on them being fabulous! Mangia!!!
  
  The directions are the same, except that this is a wetter dough.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Prepare a baking sheet with cooking spray
  or a very light coating of oil. In a large mixing bow, sift together flour,
  cornmeal, baking powder, and salt. Lightly beat the eggs and add them to
  the flour mixture. Stir in the maple syrup, vanilla, and walnuts, mixing
  just until the dough is smooth. Using a rubber spatula and floured hands,
  scoop half of the dough out of the bowl and onto one side of the baking
  sheet. Shape the dough into a 15" long log. Make a second log on the other
  side of the baking tray with the remaining dough. Space the logs at least
  6" apart. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until the top of each biscotti log is
  firm. Remove them with a long spatula to a wire rack and cool for 10-15
  minutes. Cut each log on a severe diagonal into about 20 1/2" thick slices
  and place them, cut side down, on the baking sheet. Reduce the oven
  temperature to 350 degrees and bake for 15 minutes. Hot from the oven, the
  biscotti might be slightly soft in the center, but they will harden as they
  cool. Allow them to cool completely. Stored in a tin or other tightly
  closed container, they will keep for at least a couple of weeks.
