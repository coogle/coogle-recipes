      <step>  Peel, quarter, and slice the onions. Scrub the potatoes, and if they are
  very samll, cut in 1/4-inch slices; if they're larger, quarter them
  lengthwise, then slice them.
  
  Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil in a large non-stick saute pan. Cook the
  onions, potatoes, and garlic in the oil, with a little salt, stirring them
  often until they are tender.
  
  Drain the marinated artichoke hearts well and trim off any tough, fibrous
  leaves. Quarter the artichoke hearts and add them to the potatoes and
  onions in the pan; stir everything together, then remove the pan from the
  heat.
  
  Beat the eggs in a large bowl with 1/2 teaspoon of salt, the chopped
  parsley, grated Parmesan cheese, and black pepper to taste. Add all the
  vegetables in the pan to the eggs, and stir it all together.
  
  Clean the saute pan to remove the starchy residue from the potatoes, wipe
  it dry, and then heat the remaining 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil in it. Pour
  in the egg and vegetable mixture, spreading it evenly, lower the heat to a
  very small flame, and cover the pan. Cook the frittata for 8-10 minutes, or
  until the eggs at the top are almost set.
  
  Put the pan under a hot broiler for a few minutes to finish the frittata.
  It should be just slightly golden brown on top. Loosen the frittata gently
  with a knife or spatula until it moves freely in the pan, then slide it out
  onto a platter or place a platter over the pan and invert. Cut the frittata
  in wedges to serve.
  
  This is best eaten warm or at room temperature, so if you are taking it to
  a picnic, pack it into the hamper rather than the cooler. If you must keep
  it longer than a few hours, refrigerate it but allow it to come to room
  temperature before serving for best flavor.
