      <step>  Preheat the oven to 350F. Pour the prepared cake batter onto a 10" x 15"
  rimmed baking sheet or jelly-roll pan that has been coated with nonstick
  baking spray. Bake for 22 to 24 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick
  inserted in the center comes out clean. Allow to cool, then invert onto
  large platter. Cut crosswise into 3 sections, each measureing 5" x 10".
  Reserve 1 cup whipped topping for the frosting. Spread some of the
  remaining whipped topping over the middle section of cake, completely
  covering it. Lay 2 bananas parallel to each other over the whipped topping.
  Spoon more whipped topping over the bananas, then place the third banana on
  top. Cover with the remaining whipped topping. Gently bring up the 2 side
  pieces of cake from the outer edges to form the bungalow roof. Frost the
  cake with the reserved whipped topping, then cover with the sprinkles.
  Refrigerate for at least 1 hour, then slice and serve.
