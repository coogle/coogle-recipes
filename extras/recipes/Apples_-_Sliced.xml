      <step>  Quantity: An average of 19 pounds is needed per canner load of 7 quarts; an
  average of 12-1/4 pounds is needed per canner load of 9 pints. A bushel
  weighs 48 pounds and yields 16 to 19 quarts-an average of 2-3/4 pounds per
  quart.
  
  Quality: Select apples that are juicy, crispy, and preferably both sweet
  and tart.
  
  Procedure: Wash, peel, and core apples. To prevent discoloration, slice
  apples into water containing ascorbic acid. Raw packs make poor quality
  products. Place drained slices in large saucepan and add 1 pint water or
  very light, light, or medium syrup (see "Preparing and Using Syrups") per 5
  pounds of sliced apples. Boil 5 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent
  burning. Fill jars with hot slices and hot syrup or water, leaving 1/2-inch
  headspace. Adjust lids and process.
  
  Processing directions for canning sliced apples in a boiling-water, a dial,
  or a weighted-gauge canner are given in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3.
  
  Table 1. Recommended process time for Apples, sliced in a boiling-water
  canner.
  
  Style of Pack: Hot.  Jar Size: Pints or Quarts. Process Time at Altitudes
  of 0 - 1,000 ft: 20 min.
                           1,001 - 3,000 ft: 25 min.
                           3,001 - 6,000 ft: 30 min.
                             Above 6,000 ft: 35 min.
  
  Table 2. Process Times for Sliced Apples in a Dial-Gauge Pressure Canner.
  
  Style of Pack: Hot.  Jar Size: Pints or Quarts. Process Time: 8 min. Canner
  Pressure (PSI) at Altitudes of 0 - 2,000 ft: 6 lb.
                                    2,001 - 4,000 ft: 7 lb.
                                    4,001 - 6,000 ft: 8 lb.
                                    6,001 - 8,000 ft: 9 lb.
  
  Table 3. Process Times for Sliced Apples in a Weighted-Gauge Pressure
  Canner.
  
  Style of Pack: Hot.  Jar Size: Pints or Quarts. Process Time: 8 min. Canner
  Pressure (PSI) at Altitudes of 0 - 1,000 ft: 5 lb.
                                      Above 1,000 ft: 10 lb.
