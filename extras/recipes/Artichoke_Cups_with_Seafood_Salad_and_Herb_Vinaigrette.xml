  1. For the vinaigrette, whisk lemon juice with white or sherry vinegar,
  Dijon-style mustard, and garlic clove. Add parsley and basil and season to
  taste. Whisk in olive oil, set aside.
  
  2. Heat 1 inch of water to boiling in a large soup kettle.

  basket in kettle, cover, and steam over medium-high heat until artichoke
  base is easily pierced with the tip of a knife, 30 to 40 minutes.

  center and pulling out as a single clump. Remove choke (hairy material at
  base of artichoke) with a spoon. Cover and refrigerate.
  
  5. Toss shrimp with crabmeat, scallion, and 1/4 cup of vinaigrette.
  
  6. Drizzle an additional 2 tablespoons of vinaigrette onto each artichoke
  so that each leaf is lightly coated.
  
  7. Toss remaining vinaigrette with radicchio and lettuce.
  
  8. Arrange a portion of shredded lettuce on each of 4 salad plates, fill
  
  each artichoke cup with a portion of seafood salad. Place a filled
  artichoke on top of each bed of lettuce and serve.
