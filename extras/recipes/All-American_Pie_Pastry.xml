      <step>  To ensure a tender crust, this recipe should not be doubled. Thoroughly
  freezing the lard or shortening will give you the flakiest crust.
  
  PLACE THE FLOUR AND SALT in the bowl of a food processor and pulse 2-3
  times. Scatter the lard or shortening over the flour mixture. Sprinkle with
  the water and process about 5 seconds or until dough just begins to form.
  Shape into a ball, then flatten it slightly. Dust lightly with flour and
  place in the center of a 2-gallon-size plastic storage bag. It may be
  refrigerated at this point up to 40 minutes. With the storage bag open and
  the dough circle centered in the bag, roll the dough into a circle that
  almost touches the edges of the bag. Cut and discard the top sheet of the
  plastic bag so that the dough is lying on the bottom sheet. Flip onto the
  pie plate; peel the plastic off and discard. Cut the pastry so it hangs
  about an inch over the rim. Lightly press the overhanging pastry under
  (between the pastry and the pie tin). Pinch or crease the edges of the
  pastry in a zigzag or fluted pattern. This is not only decorative, it also
  acts as a wall to keep the filling in. Yield: 1 single-crust 8- to 10-inch
  pie shell.
