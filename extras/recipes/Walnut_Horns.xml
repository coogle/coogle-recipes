      <step>  Cream the flour and butter.  Mix in the sour cream and the egg yolk.
  
  Divide the dough into four parts, wrap in plastic wrap, and chill for
  several hours.
  
  Mix together the brown sugar, walnuts and cinnamon.
  
  Roll each dough section on a floured surface until about 1/8 inch thick.
  Spread about 1/4 of the sugar/walnut/cinnamon mixture over each rolled
  dough section. Cut the dough into pie-shaped wedges and roll, beginning at
  the wide end.
  
  Place cookies on an ungreased cookie sheet.  Brush with melted butter
  (about 2 T should be enough). Bake for about 20 minutes at 375 degrees F.
  If you remove the cookies from the oven before they turn brown, the dough
  will be softer and flakier. If you remove them after they have browned
  slightly, the dough will be crisper.
  
  Remove cookies from cookie sheet before they have cooled completely, or
  else they stick to the cookie sheet.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Rolled, walnut-filled cookies -- This recipe has been in the family for
  a while. These cookies make great Christmas gifts.
  
  *  During my childhood, these cookies tasted wonderful. However, now they
  strike me as a bit sweet. You could probably decrease the amount of brown
  sugar by 1/4 to 1/2 and make up for the loss in volume by increasing the
  amount of nuts.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  Initial preparation:  10 minutes; chilling: at least 2 hours;
