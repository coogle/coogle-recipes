      <step>  I think the only "Singaporean" dish I have is one for a curried
  noodle dish known as Singapore Noodles every where in Asian except
  Singapore where they never seem to have heard of it.  Stay tuned
  though. I'll see what I can come up with.
  
  Well, it's a little later and we're in luck!  I found three Singapore
  recipes in Joyce Jue's "Asian Appetizers".  Here's da foist...
  
  Although most Asian lunches and dinners include a soup, there are
  certain soups which are served as a snack or even for breakfast.  In
  Singapore, one of my favorite ways to start a day is to trek over to
  a hawker's stall and have a bowl of pork rib "tea" (actually a clear
  soup tinted with soy sauce).  It comes with Chinese crullers for
  dunking, and a strong black tea which I think of as the "espresso" of
  teas.  This recipe comes from the Straits Cafe in San Francisco.  The
  crullers, baguette-shaped fried savory pastries, may be purchased at
  better Asian markets.
  
  1.  Combine the pork, garlic, and water in a large saucepan; bring to
  a boil and cook for 5 minutes.  Skim and discard the scum from the
  surface. Add the cinnamon, star anise, peppercorns, sugar, salt, and
  soy sauce. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until the pork is
  tender, about 45 minutes.  Discard the excess fat from the soup
  before serving.
  
  2.  Serve the soup in deep bowls with 3 to 4 rib pieces per serving
  and shallot flakes scattered over the top.  Combine soy sauce and
  chiles to taste in small bowls as a dipping sauce for the ribs.
  Serve with cruller slices for dunking into the broth, and a bowl of
  rice on the side.
  
  Makes 4 to 6 servings.
  
  CRISP FRIED SHALLOT AND GARLIC FLAKES:
  
  Cut 8 shallots or garlic cloves crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick slices;
  you should have 3/4 cup of slices.  The slices must all be of equal
  thickness to assure even cooking.  Heat 2 cups of vegetable oil to
  300F in a preheated wok, saucepan, or skillet.  Add the slices and
  fry slowly for 3 to 5 minutes or until golden brown and crisp.  They
  should be completely dry with no remaining moisture.  Remove with a
  fine strainer and drain on paper towels.  When cool, store in an
  airtight container. The flakes will keep for several weeks.  Makes
  about 1/2 cup.
  
  Makes about 1/2 cup.
  
  NOTE:  The flavored oil can be strained and used for stir-frying.
