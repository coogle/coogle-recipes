    <directions>
      <step>  1. Peel artichokes*: break off each leaf at the base (bend the leaf back on
  itself until it snaps, then pull it off towards the base). When most of the
  outer leaves have been peeled off and the remaining leaves no longer snap,
  cut off the rest of the cone and rub the cut portions with the lemon to
  prevent discoloration.
  
  2. Using a sharp paring knife, trim off all bits of green to expose the
  more tender white part of the artichoke bottom. Rub with the lemon.
  
  3. Place the artichoke bottoms in a saucepan with the lemon juice and
  enough water to cover. Simmer, covered, for 30-45 minutes or until the
  artichoke bottoms are tender when pierced wlth a knife. Cool in liquid and
  reserve.
  
  4. Heat the oil in a skillet over low heat. Saute tht onion until lightly
  browned. Add the spinach and cook, stirring constantly, until wilted.
  
  5. Place the spinach, walnuts, and cream in a food processor and puree.
  Season with salt and pepper.
  
  6. Remove the artichoke bottoms from their liquid. Rinse under cold water
  and remove the choke with a spoon. When finished, you should have 2
  perfectly rounded, hollowed-out cups per serving.
  
  7. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Fill the artichoke bottoms with spinach
  cream. Place in a glass baking dish large enough to hold all the bottoms in
  one layer. Drizzle with the broth or beer, cover with aluminum foil, and
  bake for 25 minutes, basting occasionally. Just before serving, douse with
  the remaining liquid from the bottom of the pan.
  
  SERVES 4 in 2 hrs of moderately difficult preparation. Serve as an
  appetizer; or serve with a pasta entree: spaghetti with oil and garlic
  sauce and lemon; as part of a buffet.
  
  MAKE AHEAD: The artichoke bottoms will keeps refrigerated in their cooking
  liquid for 1 to 2 days.
  
  *TIP: Using this method instead of cutting off the leaves with a knife will
  result in a meatier artichoke bottom.
  
  *LOWFAT CREAMS (thin as needed): lowfat or nonfat sour cream; sour cream
  substitutes; soy cream; lowfat or nonfat yogurt; ricotta; pureed lowfat or
  nonfat cottage cheese with skim milk; "creamed" tofu; nonfat cream (new
  product 1997).

  Puree of spinach, walnuts, and cream as a filling for prepared bottoms and
  cooked until the flavors blend. The leaves may be used to flavor a soup or
  a marinara sauce. Or puree the tender parts of the leaves and use them
  instead of the spinach in this recipe.
