  I had my parents over for dinner at the last minute tonight.  I made this
  recipe which I've posted here before, but I varied it enough to warrant
  posting it again.  As a side dish, I made minute rice. I microwaved it in
  chicken broth and a small amount of tarragon for 2 minutes. Nice and
  simple.  For dessert I made this peach stuff that was somewhat like a
  milkshake ("Peach Nutmeg Frappe").  I got it from a "Cooking Light" special
  magazine that I picked up today.  I was pleased with both recipes.
