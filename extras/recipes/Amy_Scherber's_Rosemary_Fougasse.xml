      <step>  A variation on the Crusty Italian Bread.  Mix the dough according to the
  instructions given in the recipe.
  
  After the dough has taken its first rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hours (or
  overnight) it can be shaped into a fougasse. Place the dough on a lightly
  floured surface and pat it into a long narrow rectangle. Sprinkle a layer
  of chopped rosemary over the surface of the dough being careful to cover
  the edges too. Fold the dough in thirds like a business letter, the top
  third over the middle of the dough, then the bottom third over that,
  completely overlapping the two. Press the 3 open sides of the fougasse
  tightly shut. Cover the bread well with plastic wrap and let rise until
  doubled in bulk, about 1 to 2 hours.
  
  Thirty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 475 degrees F. Place a
  baking stone in the oven to preheat and position an oven rack just below
  the stone.
  
  Sprinkle a peel or upside-down baking sheet generously with cornmeal and
  place the fougasse on top, stretching it slightly to make it into a square.
  Cut a decorative pattern, such as a leaf or a ladder, into the dough with a
  dough cutter. Spread and stretch the loaf until the cuts form large
  openings.
  
  Be sure the fougasse is loosened from the peel, then carefully slide it
  onto the baking stone. Using a plant sprayer, quickly mist the bread with
  water 8 to 10 times, then quickly shut oven door. Mist again after 1
  minute. Then mist again 1 minute later.
  
  Bake for about 10 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 450 degrees and
  bake 15 minutes longer or until the loaf sounds slightly hollow when tapped
  on the bottom and the crust is a medium to dark brown. (If the crust is not
  brown enough, the bread will soften as it cools.) Transfer the bread to a
  rack to cool for at least 30 minutes before serving.
