    <directions>
      <step>  Place the beets, unpeeled, in a foil-lined baking dish. Cover with more
  foil and seal the edges of the top and bottom layers of foil to completely
  enclose the beets. Place them in a 400 degree oven and bake for
  approximately 20 minutes or until the beets are tender when pierced with a
  sharp paring knife.
  
  While the beets are baking peel the oranges. First cut a thin slice from
  the top and bottom of the orange so that it can sit firmly on the
  countertop. Using a sharp paring knife cut the peel and pith off with
  sawing downward strokes so that the orange is completely peeled. Cut the
  individual sections out from the membranes. Place in a mixing bowl together
  with the onion and mint.
  
  When the beets are tender hold them under running water and slip the skins
  off. Trim the stem end, then cut them in half and then into slices. Add the
  beet slices to the bowl with the oranges. Season with salt and pepper to
  taste than drizzle the orange olive oil over to taste. Toss to mix. Can be
  served immediately or allowed to marinate up to 2 days.
