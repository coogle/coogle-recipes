      <step>  Like croissants, bagels, have transcended their origins to become
  all-American. These are chubby bagels - boiled, then baked - with a cakey,
  open sponge; they are not heavy, stretchy, or chewy. They are made with
  high-gluten flour, the kind your local pizza maker uses. He might give you
  some, or you can order the flour by mail, but don't let not getting your
  hands on this stop you from bageling - you'll like what you get if you use
  bread flour or unbleached all-purpose flour.
  
  Brush the inside of a large (about 8-quart) bowl with some of the melted
  butter; set aside. Reserve the remaining melted butter for coating the top
  of the dough.
  
  Mixing and Kneading: Whisk the yeast into 1/4 cup of the tepid water. Add a
  pinch of sugar and let the mixture rest until the yeast has dissolved and
  is creamy.
  
  Pour the remaining 2 cups water into a large bowl and add the shortening.
  Add the yeast mixture along with 2 tablespoons sugar, the salt, and the
  black pepper, if you're using it, and stir with a wooden spoon to mix.
  
  Stirring vigorously with the wooden spoon, add the flour, 1/2 cup at a
  time, stopping when you have a soft, sticky dough that is difficult to
  stir. (You will probably use almost 6 cups of flour, but the dough will
  still be soft and sticky - and that's just the way it's supposed to be.)
  Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and knead for 5 to 6
  minutes, until it is smooth and elastic. Add additional flour as needed to
  keep the dough from sticking to you hands and the works surface.
  
  (To make the dough in a mixer, proof the yeast in 1/4 cup of the warm water
  in the mixer's bowl. Fit the machine with the dough hook and add the
  remaining 2 cups water, the sugar, shortening, salt, and the pepper, if
  using it; mix on low to blend. With the machine still on low, gradually add
  5 1/2 to 6 cups of the flour, mixing for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the
  ingredients are blended. With the machine still on low, gradually add 5 1/2
  to 6 cups of the flour, mixing for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the ingredients
  are blended. Increase the miser speed to medium and knead for about 6
  minutes, adding additional four by the tablespoon until the dough is smooth
  and elastic. At this point, the dough may still be slightly sticky and it
  may not clean the sides and bottom of the bowl completely - that's OK.)
  
  Rise: Form the dough into a ball and transfer it to the buttered mixing
  bowl. Brush the top of the dough with a little melted butter, cover the
  bowl with buttered plastic wrap, and top with a kitchen towel. Let the
  dough rise at room temperature for about 1 hour, or until it doubles in
  bulk.
  
  Chilling the Dough: Deflate the dough, cover as before, and refrigerate for
  4 hours, or, if it's more convenient, overnight. *** At this point, the
  dough can be well wrapped and refrigerated for up to 2 days. ***
  
  When you're ready to make the bagels, position an oven rack in the lower
  third of the oven and preheat the oven to 500¡F. If the bagels are to bake
  on a stone, preheat the baking stone too and generously dust a peel with
  cornmeal. If they will bake on baking sheets, brush the sheets with
  vegetable oil (or spray them) and dust them with cornmeal. For added
  flavor, use one or all of the suggested topping ingredients in combination
  with the cornmeal to dust the peel or the sheets. (To create steam in the
  oven, you'll be tossing ice cubes and water onto the oven floor. If you
  don't think you oven floor is up to this - it can be tricky with a gas oven
  ~ put a heavy skillet or roasting pan on the oven floor and preheat it as
  well.)
  
  While the oven preheats, fill a stockpot with water and bring the water to
  a rapid boil.
  
  Line 2 baking sheets or trays with kitchen towels. Rub flour into 1 of the
  towels and place both sheets close to your work surface.
  
  Shaping the Dough: Deflate the dough and transfer it to a lightly floured
  work surface. Divide the dough in half; cover and chill one piece of the
  dough while you work with the other. Cut the dough into 5 equal pieces;
  work with 1 piece at a time and cover the remaining pieces with a towel.
