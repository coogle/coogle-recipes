      <step>  Roast a poblano or long green chile; peel, seed and slice. In a large
  skillet filmed with oil, quickly fry an onion over mediium-high heat until
  it begins to brown, then add the chile. Cut 1 to 1 1/3 pounds ham steak
  into 4 portions and nestle them into the skilet. Mix together 1 cup of
  orange juice with 3 tablespoons Adobo de Achiote, taste for salt, drizzle
  over the ham, cover and cook over low heat for 15 minutes. Uncover and
  simmer over medium-high until the liquid is reduced to about 1/4 cup (it'll
  start to look thik). Serve the ham topped with the vegetables and a drizzle
  of the pan juices. For a fruiter version, add 1 cup of chopped fresh
  pineapple along with the orange juice.
