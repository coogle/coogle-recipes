      <step>  I got this recipe from "GOURMET ON THE GO" put out by Ideals It sounds
  really good
  
  A Spanish dish, full flavored but not spicy hot
  
  Trim meat, then cut in strips or cubes and brown in fat (I would use olive
  oil) Add green pepper, onion, celery, garlic, mushrooms and soup and
  simmer, covered, for 45 to 60 minutes. Add wine and olives 10 to 15 minutes
  before serving. Add 1/3 cup water if there is insufficient sauce Yield: 4
  servings
  
  I have had several people ask where to get the Ideal Cookbooks and I found
  an address in the back of this one. These books came out in 1978 and came
  out by monthly. I don't know if you can still get them or not but the
  address is: Ideals Publishing Corp.
    11315    Watertown Plank Rd. Milwaukee, WI. 53226
  
  You may look in your local bookstores, gift shops,greeting card shop or
  stationery stores.
  
  I have never made anything out of these books that didn't turn out good.
