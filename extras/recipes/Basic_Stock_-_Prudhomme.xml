      <step>  Notes:  To the basic stock, you can also add vegetable trimmings from the
  recipe(s) you are serving, in place of the onion, garlic and celery. The
  recipe calls for the onion and garlic to be unpeeled and quartered.
     Also, you may include bones and any excess meat (excluding livers) from
  meat or poultry, or shells or carcasses from seafood, used in the recipe(s)
  you're cooking, or FOR FOWL AND GAME STOCKS: 1 1/2 to 2 pounds backs, necks
  and/or bones from chickens, guinea hens, ducks, geese, rabbits, etc. FOR
  BEEF OR TURTLE STOCKS: 1-1/2 to 2 pounds beef shank (preferred) or other
  beef or turtle bones. FOR PORK STOCK:  1-1/2 to 2 pounds pork neck bones
  (preferred) or other pork bones. FOR SEAFOOD STOCK: 1-1/2 to 2 pounds
  rinsed shrimp heads and/or shells, or crawfish heads and/or shells, or crab
  shells (2-1/2 to 3 quarts), or rinsed fish carcasses (heads and gills
  removed), or any combination of these. (you can also substitute oyster
  liquor for all or part of seafood stock called for in a recipe). NOTE: If
  desired, you can first roast meat bones and vegetables at 350F until
  thoroughly browned.
   Then use them to make your basic stock.  (When you brown the bones and
  vegetables, the natural sugar in both caramelizes on the surface, which
  gives the stock a fuller taste and adds color when it dissolves in the
  stock water.) Always start with cold water--enough to cover the other stock
  ingredients.  Place all ingredients in a stock pot or a large saucepan.
  Bring to a boil over high heat, then gently simmer at least 4 hours,
  preferably 8 (unless directed otherwise in a recipe), replenishing the
  water as needed to keep about 1 quart of liquid in the pan. The pot may be
  uncovered, or set the lid on it askew.  Strain, cool and refrigerate until
  ready to use.  (Note: Remember if you are short on time, using a stock
  simmered 20 to 30 minutes is far better than using just water in any
  recipe..) TO MAKE A RICH STOCK: Strain the basic stock, then continue
  simmering until evaporation reduces the liquid by half or more. For
  example, if your recipe calls for 1 cup "Rich Stock," start it with at
  least 2 cups of strained basic stock.  (Rich stocks are needed when a sauce
  requires lots of taste but only a limited amount of liquid, for example,
