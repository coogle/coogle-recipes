      <step>  THE SPICE GRINDER METHOD: In a spice grinder, pulverize the achiote as
  finely as possible, then dump it into a small bowl. Pulverize the allspice
  and black pepper (if you're using whole) along with the oregano, and add to
  the achiote. Sprinkle in the cider vinegar and mix thoroughly (it'll be a
  damp powder at this point and won't hold together). Roughly chop the
  garlic, sprinkle it with salt, then, right back to your cutting board, use
  the back of a spoon or the side of a knife to work it back and forth into a
  paste. Little by little, work in the spice mixtire (it probably still won't
  hold together). Last, work in a tablespoon or two of water, if it's needed
  to give the mixture the consistency of a thick paste.
  
  THE MINICHOPPER METHOD: Pulverize the achiote, allspice, peppercorns and
  oregano together with the sharp blade. Add the vinegar to the spices, along
  with the garlic and salt. Pulse until the garlic is roughly chopped, then
  let the machine run until everything is as smooth as possible. Dribble in a
  tablespoon or two of water, if its necessary to bring everything together
  into a thick, pasty consistency.
  
  ADVANCE PREPARATION: This seasoning will last for several months in the
  refrigerator, if tightly coverd (I suggest a small jar).
  
  TRADITIONAL DISHES THAT USE THIS ESSENTIAL AS A STARTING POINT: Yucatecan
  Grilled Fish Tacos, Achiote-Roasted Pork Tacos, Achiote Rice Supper with
  Pork Carnitas, Achiote-Grilled Turkey Breast, Tomato-Braised Grouper
  
  NOTES: Achiote is the saffron of Mexico; If it's not fresh or if it's used
  in tiny pinches, the orangey color is all you notice. More than a pinch of
  fresh achiote gives any dish an exotic. earthy perfume that to me is as
  captivating as good, musky saffron; it's certainly less expensive. You'll
  know you've got fresh achiote when the little chalky-feeling seeds have a
  punchy aroma and a vibrant rusty color that's more red than orange.
  
  Though in Oaxaca they make "pure" achiote past (it has only a little salt,
  sugar and acid added), it is the Yucatecan garlic-flavored, spice-riddled
  achiote past that most Mexicans use. Even in the States Yucatecan achiote
  past is available in most Mexican groceries. Homemade achiote paste has the
  brightest, most concentrated flavors (some of the commercial brans contain
  fillers), and it's really very simple. Smeared over fish before it's
  grilled, slathered on pork before it's braised or roasted, stirred in tamal
  dough before it's steamed -- achiote reveals the genius of Mexican cooks.
  Not spicy-hot here, but spicy-complex without chile. My version nods more
  in that direction than some I've encountered. Silvio Campos, a Yucatecan
  who came to Frontera Grill to make his famous pork pibil, made his with
  double the achiote of mine and half the spices. Try that version for an
  even more true-to-achiote flavor.
