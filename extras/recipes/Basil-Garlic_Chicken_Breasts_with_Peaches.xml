    <directions>
      <step>  with the two halves still attached, substitute 8 halves.
  
  INSTRUCTIONS: In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the vinegar
  to a boil and cook until it is reduced by half, 20 to 25 minutes. Stir in
  the molasses and black pepper, remove from the heat and set aside.
  
  Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the basil, garlic and olive oil, and
  mix well. Rub the chicken breasts with this mixture, sprinkle lightly with
  salt and pepper, and grill over a medium fire, skin side down, until the
  skin is crispy, 8 to 10 minutes. Turn the breasts over and grill for
  another 6 minutes. To check for doneness, nick one of the breasts at the
  fattest point; the meat should be fully opaque with no traces of pink.
  
  As the chicken breasts are finishing up, place the peaches on the fire, cut
  side down, and grill until they are nicely browned, about 2 minutes. Flip
  them over, brush the cut side with the balsamic glaze, and continue to cook
  for another 2 minutes. Remove the peaches from the grill, give them another
  coat of glaze, and serve whole or sliced with the chicken breasts.
