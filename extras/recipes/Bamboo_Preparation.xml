      <step>  When bamboo is cultivated for shoots, workers walk the fields barefoot,
  heaping soil around those spots where their toes feel a slight rise in the
  ground.  The bulge heralds an emerging culm, which is kept covered as long
  possible, sometimes with a wooden box, because when exposed it becomes fibr
  in a short time.  The shoot is harvested when about 1 foot tall, by digging
  down and carefully severing it at the point where it joins the rhizome bear
  it.  Shoots are boiled a half hour or more and the outer sheaths removed.
  They are white in color, with the look of a raw paotato, crisp in texture.
  
  Shoots of almost any bamboo can be eaten.  The principal genera used for
  sprouts include Arundinaria, Bambusa, Dendrocalamus, and Phyllostachys.
  Although the size is one limiting factor, even diminutive Sasa in Japan
  provides some 600 tons of shoots annually.
  
  In Taiwan P. edulis and D. latiflorus are used.  In Japan P. moso and P edu
  are used.  Soft quality shoots require yearly soil dressing, straw litter a
  farmyard manure..
  
  A sprout properly dug will have a rooty, woody basal portin, increasing
  sharply in diameter upwad for a short distance from the very slender part
  which  was attached to its rhizome, and then tapering to a point.  With a
  sharp paring knife cut lengthwise through the sheath only, from tip to base
  the sprout.  Beginning with the lowersheaths, remove all except the tender
  ones at the tip.  If there is a grayish layer (owing to age) next to the lo
  nodes, pare this off.  Remove the togh basal part.  Cut the core portion
  diagonally or crosswise into rather this slices.  The lower, firmer portion
  should be cut across the grain, not thicker than 1/8 inch, but the more ten
  middle and upper parts may be sliced thicker or cut into varioyus shapes
  according to the recipe.  Sprouts may be served alone, drained, with butter
  melted over them, after boiling for about twenty minutes.  Salt is added ne
  the end of the boiling period.  If the fresh sprouts are unpleasantly bitte
  to the taste there should be a change of water after the first ten minutes
  cooking.  The more pronounced bitterness of some of the tropical edible
  bamboos (of the genus Bambusa and others) may be removed by a third change
  water if the bamboo is not sliced too thicvk and a good volume of water is
  used.
