  I tried this recipe from Sarah Schlesinger's cookbook "500 Fat-Free
  Recipes," and it is very good. I've had a slice of this bread and a cup of
  nonfat yogurt for breakfast the last few days. The bread is also a good
  evening snack. Thought others in the group would like it.  BTW, I love
  Sarah Schlesinger's cookbook--heard about it on this list, too! Every
  recipe I have tried has come out very well. I heartily recommend it.
  
  Combine the flour, baking powder, salt, sugar, and cinnamon. Stir in the
  applesauce, egg whites, and milk. Pour into a nonstick loaf pan, or a pan
  lined witha baking pan liner or lightly sprayed with vegetable cooking
  spray. Let stand for 1 hour.
  
  Preheat oven to 325F. Bake bread for 50 minutes or until a wooden pick
  inserted in the center of the bread comes out dry. Cool in pan for 10
  minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool. Makes 10 servings.
  
  You could probably add chopped, dried fruit to this recipe without any
  problems. Also, soy or rice milk (or even spice tea) could probably be
  substituted for the skim milk. To make it more of a spice bread, next time
  I will reduce the cinnamon to 2 1/2 teaspoons and add 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg,
  1/8 teaspoon cloves, and 1/8 teaspoon cardamom.
