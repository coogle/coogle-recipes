      <step>  :    Hand beat egg whites until somewhat frothy. Combine flour, sugar
  and salt and add to egg whites; beat until smooth, losing grainy
  look. Add vanilla. Beat again. Add cream and stir until well blended.
  Have ready a baking dish, Pyrex or deep metal pan (milk pan) lined
  with a short pastry which has been chilled in refrigerator for some
  time. Pour cream mixture into crust and bake in a very slow oven, 250
  ~275 degrees F., for 4 hours. It must not boil.  Best done the day
  before and allowed to set. :    This cream pie, a fifth or sixth
  generation recipe, has a custard like texture and a delicious flavor.
  A. K. (Binx) Gardner had the recipe from Mrs. Obadiah Gardner, his
  mother, who had it from her mother and grandmother.  The pie is
  cooked in a very slow oven for 4 hours and allowed to set for at
  least another day before it is served. This is a large pie. A small
  "sliver" of the pie makes a good dessert.
