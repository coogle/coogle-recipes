    <directions>
      <step>  1. Have fish cleaned and scaled, but left whole. Rinse in cold water. Dry
  well, inside and out, with paper toweling and score on both sides.
  
  2. Sprinkle fish with the salt and let stand 10 minutes. Then coat lightly
  with flour.
  
  3. Mince ginger root and scallions; then combine with water, soy sauce,
  sherry, sugar and remaining salt.
  
  4. Heat oil in a heavy pan until nearly smoking. Gently lower in fish; fry
  over high heat 1 minute on each side, then over medium heat 2-1/2 minutes
  on each side. Baste continually with hot oil. (To turn fish over, loosen it
  with the back of a spatula and turn gently. The pan may be removed
  temporarily from the burner while the fish is being turned.)
  
  5. Pour ginger-scallion mixture over fish and bring quickly to a boil. Then
  cook, covered, over medium heat until done (15 to 20 minutes), turning fish
  halfway through cooking.
  
  NOTE: Braised soy fish is good served hot or cold. It may be prepared in
  quantity and served cold as a side dish or with drinks. (Its sauce is
  delicious when jellied.) Braised fish may also be browned in advance, then
  cooked in sauce, as in step 5, just before serving. Once it's completely
  cooked, however, it should never be reheated. VARIATIONS:
  
  1. For the water, substitute stock.
  
  2. For the white sugar, substitute brown sugar.
  
  3. In step 2, omit the salt and rub fish lightly with soy sauce before
  coating with flour.
  
  4. In step 3, add to the sauce mixture any or all of the following: 2
  tablespoons smoked ham, minced; 1 celery stalk, minced; few drops of sesame
  oil or vinegar.
  
  5. During the last few minutes of cooking, add 1-1/2 cups fresh tomatoes,
  peeled and diced; or 2 cups bean curd, sliced or cubed. Cook only to heat
  through.
