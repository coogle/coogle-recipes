    I like vegetables as much as I do meat, perhaps more. There is no reason
  why you cannot put something into your barbecue cooker other than potatoes
  and meat. Try this one. Even your children will eat their vegetables.
  
    Trim the ends of the squash and cut each lengthwise in half and then each
  piece into quarters. Marinate in the salad dressing for 1/2 hour before
  cooking. Place on the charcoal grill and add salt and pepper to taste.
  These pieces should cook in very little time, so watch them. Nobody likes
  soggy zucchini!
