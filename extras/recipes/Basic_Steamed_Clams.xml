      <step>  1. Prepare "Dip for Clams" (see recipe).
  
  2. Wash clams, in their shells, under cold running water to remove sand.
  Scrub with a brush if necessary.
  
  3. Place clams on a shallow heatproof platter. Steam until clam shells open
  (5 to 10 minutes). See "How-to Section".
  
  4. Serve clams in their shells, with the dip on the side.
  
  NOTE: Clams may also be opened by boiling. Pour over boiling water to cover
  and boil until shells open. VARIATIONS:
  
  1. In step 3, place in a deep heatproof bowl 1 pound fresh spinach, with
  tough stems removed. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons soy sauce and top with
  unopened clams. Steam as directed.
  
  2. After step 3, shell clams and toss them in the clam dip; then
  refrigerate to chill.
  
  3. After step 3, shell clams; arrange them on a heatproof platter. Pour
  over amixture of 2 tablespoons soy sauce; 1 tablespoon sherry; 1 leek stalk
  and 2 slices fresh ginger root, both minced. Steam 5 minutes more.
  
  4. In the variation above, substitute for the seasoning mixture 1
  tablespoon shrimp sauce and 1 leek stalk, minced.
