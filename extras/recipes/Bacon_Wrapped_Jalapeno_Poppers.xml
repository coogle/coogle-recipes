      <step>  Split, seed and wash jalapeno peppers. Spread cream cheese in each half of
  split peppers, either leave in halves *OR* combine the two halves to make a
  whole popper. Wrap each half/whole jalapeno with a bacon slice cut in half.
  Place each bacon wrapped jalapeno on a cookie sheet..bake at 250 til bacon
  is done, cool and serve.(Cheese will boil out if oven is set to high)
  
  This is even better cold the next day!!! I should have posted these for
  Super bowl Sunday...good with beer,wine and margaritas.
  
  *I have used fat free and low fat cream cheese, the amount varies as to how
  much cheese each individual likes in their jalapeno. **I use Turkey bacon
  for the wrap and it is really good, less fat too.
