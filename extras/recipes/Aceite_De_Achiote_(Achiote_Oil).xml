    <directions>
      <step>    Combine all ingredients in a non-reactive heavy saucepan, allow to steep
  for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally. Bring mixture to a low and gentle
  boil while stirring continuously. Remove saucepan from heat and allow to
  cool thoroughly. Strain through a very fine sieve and pour the strained oil
  into a bottle and cap tightly. This oil will remain up to 6 months if it is
  refrigerated and capped tightly. This is a MEDIUM HOT condiment.
    This oil is used both to color and to flavor dishes. Use it in place of
  vegetable oil for South American recipes. Use only annatto (achiote) seeds
  that are bright-reddish in color; seeds that are brownish are old and have
  probably lost much of their flavor.
