      <step>  I've made something similar quite often.  The only difference is I mix the
  ground meat with the rice and 1 Tbs. of Worschestershire to form meatballs.
  Once the rest of the mixture starts to boil, I add the meatballs and let
  cook for at least an hour.  The longer it cooks, the thicker it is. And
  yes, I do add golden raisins. Even thought I'm not a raisin fan, they do
  add a sweetness to the dish.  I love this over mashed potatoes!
