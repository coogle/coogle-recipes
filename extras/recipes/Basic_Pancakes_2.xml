      <step>  Ingredients:
  
  2 cups   flour 3 tsp baking powder 1/2 tsp salt (very
  important) 1/4 cup sugar 2 eggs (or equivalent egg
  beaters) 2 tblsp oil 1 cup milk Sift (I never do) dry
  ingredients in bowl and stir in liquid ingredients
  with wire whisk or spoon until mixed.  Do not beat.
  Rub griddle or fry pan with oil.  Heat until water
  dropped from your hand bounces around. Drop about 1/2
  ladel/1 large mixing spoon for each pancake.  Cook
  until bubbled all over the top and brown on bottom.
  Flip, cook until brown on other side.  Keep you
  griddle very hot at all times.
  
  Variations:
  
  1. Substitute 1 cup whole wheat flour for white flour.
  
  2.  Substitute buttermilk for whole milk and 1 tsp
  baking SODA for 1/2 tsp baking powder.
  
  3.  Put some pecan or walnut pieces in with your dry
  ingredients (this keeps them from sinking).  Or put in
  some blueberries ..  also with dry ingredients.
  
  4.  Increase your eggs.  This will make them a little
  more like a crepe. Top with sliced apples, brown sugar
  and cinnamon and fold in half.
