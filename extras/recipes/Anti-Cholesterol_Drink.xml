      <step>  I have people who swear that their cholesterol has been dramatically
  lowered after drinking one-quarter cup of this every morning (day) for a
  few weeks (probably a longer time). Supposedly they sell this on the
  streets in Florida people love it. We have made some and have decided that
  even though it doesn't taste so great, we'll get by that and see if
  anything does happen.
