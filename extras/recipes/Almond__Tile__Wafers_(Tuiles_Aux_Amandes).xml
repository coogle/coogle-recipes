    <directions>
      <step>  Preheat the oven to 350 F. Very generously grease several baking sheets.
  Set out several rolling pins, wine bottles, or other similar-sized
  cylinders for shaping wafers and lightly grease them. Warm butter in a
  small saucepan over lowest heat. Remove from the heat and set aside to melt
  and cool slightly. In a large mixing bowl, beat together the egg whites and
  salt with a wire whisk until frothy. Gradually sift in powdered sugar,
  whisking until blended and smooth. Whisk in almond extract. Gradually sift
  flour into mixture, whisking until very smooth and slightly thickened.
  Whisk in the cooled butter. Drop 4 to 5 very small rounded teaspoonfuls of
  batter onto a baking sheet, spacing them at least 3 1/4 inches apart. (Keep
  the portions very small and don't crowd them as they spread a great deal.)
  Using the tip of a table knife, and swirling in a circular motion, spread
  each spoonful of batter into a 1 3/4-inch round. Very generously sprinkle
  sliced almonds all over each round.
  
  Place on the top rack of the oven and bake for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the
  wafers are rimmed with 1/2 inch of brown. Reverse baking sheet from front
  to back halfway through baking to ensure even browning. Remove baking sheet
  from the oven and let stand for about 20 seconds. Begin gently testing the
  edges of wafers with a spatula and as soon as they are firm enough to lift
  without tearing, quickly loosen each from the sheet using a thin-edged,
  wide-bladed spatula. Immediately drape wafers over rolling pins or
  cylinders. (If the last wafers on baking sheet cool too much while others
  are being removed, return baking sheet to oven for 1 or 2 minutes to
  rewarm. They may still be difficult to remove, however.) As soon as tuiles
  are stiff, transfer from rolling pins to wire racks to cool thoroughly.
  Cool, clean, and thoroughly regrease baking sheets before reusing. Repeat
  with remaining batter. Store tuiles in an airtight container for up to a
  week. Freeze for longer storage. Handle wafers gently as they are extremely
  fragile. Makes about 30 3- to 3 1/2-inch wafers.
