      <step>  Reggie was asking for recipes for Asian soups. This is from an excellent
  cookbook I use when looking for really light recipes based on the Eat More,
  Weigh Less(tm) diet. I'm not sure how easy it is to find this book, so
  here's the ISBN in case you'd like to order it: ISBN:0-9636117-1-2.

  Soak wakame and mushrooms in 1 cup of water until soft and cut into 1"
  pieces.
  
  Saute onions in 1/4 cup of water. Add water from the soaked wakame and
  mushrooms and the rest of the water. Bring to a boil, add the wakame and
  mushrooms and cook over low flame until it is tender.
  
  Add miso to taste by diluting 1 to 2 TB of miso in a ladle full of the soup
  water, mashing and smoothing out the miso and adding it back to the pot.
  Leftover grain or noodles may be added if desired. Add other vegetables if
  desired. Makes 6 portions.
