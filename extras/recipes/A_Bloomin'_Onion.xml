      <step>  Select a well-rounded onion. Peel outer skin off. Leave root intact and cut
  off any hanging roots. Using a small, sharp knife, divide onion into four
  sections by making 2 cuts crosswise, beginning at the top and cutting
  toward root, stopping about 1/2" away. Cut each section twice. Place onion
  in bowl of enough boiling water to cover it and leave for 5 minutes. The
  sections, or petals, will begin to open. Remove onion from water and
  immerse into ice water, which will further the opening. Drain well by
  turning upside down on paper towel. Put flour into paper bag, add onion and
  shake gently to coat with flour. Roll floured onion in beaten egg to cover.
  Put cracker crumbs or coating in bag, add onion, and shake gently to coat.
  Refrigerate 1 hour before deep frying in oil to golden brown, 3 to 5
  minutes. Cooked onion can be kept for a time in warm oven.
