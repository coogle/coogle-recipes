      <step>  The many forms of Buckwheat!:
  
  Buckwheat Seed:  It's a fruit, not a grain.  Planted around the world.
  Triangular hard hull.  Fresh seeds can be sprouted; ready-to-eat in about 5
  days.
  
  Kasha:  Hulled and roasted to bring out distinctive, nutlike flavor.
  Packaged four ways; whole, coarse, medium, fine.
  
  Whole Buckwheat Groats:  Hulled and unroasted. Mild-flavored. Better than
  barley or rice!
  
  Cream of Buckwheat:  100% pure groats milled to the size of sesame seeds.
  Look like corn grits and other "cream of..." cereals, but taste better.
  
  Buckwheat Flour:  Both light and whole buckwheat flour are 100% buckwheat.
  Gluten-free.  For fiber and flavor, each contains very finely milled
  particles of buckwheat hulls (more in whole flour).
