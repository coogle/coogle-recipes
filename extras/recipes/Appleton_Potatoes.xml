      <step>  Sometime last week someone (can't remember who, and I already deleted
  it....) requested a recipe for some kind of stuffed potato. I'm not sure if
  this is what he had in mind, but it's one of our family favorites. It is
  the recipe that was used in the restaurant of the Appleton Inns in
  Massachusetts when my father managed them about ten years ago.
  
  Bake the potatoes at 400 degrees for 40 minutes or until tender (I
  sometimes "nuke 'em"). Cut the top quarter off of the potatoes and discard
  (or do what you will with them!). Scrape the potato out of the skin and
  place in a large bowl. Place the skins on a baking sheet. Sliver the bacon
  and add to the potato in the bowl. Add the remaining ingredients into the
  bowl and mix to the desired texture. Spoon the mixture back into the potato
  skins, piling high. Bake at 400 degrees for another 10-15 minutes, until
  light brown.
