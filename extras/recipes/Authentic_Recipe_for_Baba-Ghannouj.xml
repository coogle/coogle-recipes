    <directions>
      <step>  For garnish: whole parsley leaves with 1/4" of stem left on and sweet
  paprika (hot paprika or cayenne may be substituted).
  
  Roast eggplant over an open hardwood fire (in that case omit smoke extract)
  or on BBQ until skin is thoroughly charred and eggplant is totally soft
  (test with skewer). OR Roast eggplant in 500 degrees oven until totally
  soft through and through (test with skewer). Place roasted eggplant in a
  basin of cold water and remove every bit of skin. Put eggplant in colander
  to drain water away. In mortar, pound garlic with salt until reduced to a
  smooth paste. Place garlic-salt paste in food processor and add lime or
  lemon juice (I prefer lime), tehina and smoke extract if used. Process on
  continuous. If dressing coagulates (citric acid will do that to tehina),
  add JUST ENOUGH water, in a thin stream, until dressing reliquefies to a
  thick yet pourable texture (like heavy pancake batter). Place eggplant in
  shallow serving bowl. With 2 forks, shred the meat thoroughly. Do not
  process the eggplant in the food processor, as that completely ruins the
  texture, which should be somewhat stringy (but very very soft!). Blend in
  the dressing uniformly. Smooth surface of baba-ghannooj and decorate by
  sticking the parsley stem down in the b-g in a regular pattern. Sprinkle a
  little paprika between the "florets". You may also drizzle a little bit of
  extra-virgin olive oil in tiny pools here and there on the surface. Serve
  with warm Arabic bread, tomato wedges, spring onions, oil- or brine-cured
  olives (green or black) and cucumber pickles (NOT the sweet kind. Kosher
  dills work well).
