    <directions>
      <step>     1. Mince or grind pork. Mix well with cornstarch, salt and soy sauce.
  
     2. Spread mixture out flat like a pancake in a shallow heatproof dish.
  
     3. Steam on a rack until done, about 30 minutes (see "HOW-TO SECTION").
  
     Check with a fork to see that meat is no longer pink. Serve hot.
  
     NOTE: This dish is best when made with slightly fat pork.
  
     VARIATIONS: Sliver rather than grind or mince pork, and steam about 45
  minutes.
  
     In step 1, add to pork mixture any of the following:
  
      1/2    teaspoon sugar
  
        1    teaspoon peanut oil
  
  :       few drops of sesame oil
  
  :       1 or 2 slices fresh ginger root, minced
  
        1    scallion stalk, minced
  
        1    egg, beaten
  
  :       1/4 pound fresh mushrooms, minced; or 3 dried black mushrooms
  (soaked), minced
  
      1/2    cup water chestnuts, minced
  
     Or add any of the following as indicated:
  
     BLACK BEANS: Add to pork mixture 1 tablespoon fermented black beans
  (soaked), mashed, and 1 garlic clove, minced.
  
     CHINESE SAUSAGES: Place on top of pork mixture 2 Chinese sausages,
  either cut diagonally in 1/2-inch slices, or minced.
  
     DRIED OYSTERS: Add to pork mixture 4 dried oysters (soaked), minced.
  
     DUCK LIVERS: Add to pork mixture 2 dried duck livers (soaked), minced,
  and 1/2 cup water chestnuts, minced.
  
     PICKLED BAMBOO SHOOTS : Place on top of pork mixture 1/2 cup pickled
  bamboo shoots, drained.
  
     PRESERVED TURNIP: Add to pork mixture 1/2 bundle preserved turnip,
  washed and shredded, 1 tablespoon sherry and a dash of pepper.
  
     SALT CABBAGE: Add to pork mixture 1/4 to 1/2 cup salted or preserved
  cabbage, chopped. Top with 2 tablespoons water chestnuts, sliced.
  
     SALT EGG: Separate 1 salt egg. Add the white to the pork mixture along
  with 1 fresh egg, beaten; 6 water chestnuts, minced, 2 teaspoons sherry and
  a dash of pepper. Mash or cut up salt egg yolk and sprinkle on top.
  
     SALT FISH: Add to pork mixture 1/8 pound dried salted fish (soaked),
  minced, plus 1/4 cup water. Or arrange on top of pork mixture 4 strips of
  salt fish, about 3/4 inches wide by 2 inches long (soaked), and 2 slices
  fresh ginger root, minced. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon sugar and 1 tablespoon
  oil.
  
     TEA MELON: Add to pork mixture 1/2 cup tea melon, rinsed and chopped
  coarsely or diced. Or add 4 tablespoons tea melon and 1 cup bamboo shoots,
  chopped coarsely. Or add 2 tablespoons tea melon, minced; 2 tablespoons
  preserved turnip, minced; 1 tablespoon cloud ear mushrooms (soaked),
  minced, and a few drops of sesame oil.
  
     VEGETABLES: Add to pork mixture any of the following:
  
     1 Cup cauliflower, broken into tiny flowerets or cut in 1-inch pieces
  and parboiled.
  
     1/4 cup carrots, diced and parboiled.
  
     1/4 cup cup Chinese turnips, diced and parboiled.
  
     Instead of blending the soy sauce with the pork mixture, as in step 1,
  sprinkle soy over the top with a circular motion in step 2. Minced
  scallions can be sprinkled over the pork in the same way.
