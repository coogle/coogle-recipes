      <step>  Avgolemono is easy to make and creates quit a stir at a formal dinner
  party.  It is an almost ethereal sauce, light, foamy, and a beautiful pale
  yellow color. It is a great accompaniment to roasted meat or chicken, or
  poached fish, and it is heartily recommended for boiled artichokes. Add
  another cup of chicken stock and serve this as a perfect first course soup.
  
  In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs with a whisk until lemon colored and
  frothy, then beat in the lemon juice until the mixture is very foamy. Whisk
  in the hot stock a little at a time until the sauce is light in color and
  foamy.  Serve immediately.
  
  Yield: About 2 cups
