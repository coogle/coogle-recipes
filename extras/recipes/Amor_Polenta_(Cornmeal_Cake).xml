      <step>  Amor Polenta (Cornmeal Cake) will be the sweet ending to our Valentine's
  Day Dinner. I can't resist this cake. It's simple, but rich like a fine
  pound cake with the subtle flavor and crunch of cornmeal. So forget about
  the calories and cholesterol and celebrate the "day of amour" with Amor
  Polenta.

  Cream the butter and cup of sugar with a whisk, if you have one, of an
  electric mixer until very light and fluffy, about 5 minutes at medium
  speed. Add the eggs and egg yolks, one at a time, beating thoroughly after
  each addition. The batter should be lemony yellow. Stir in the liqueur.
  Sift the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt together and fold into
  the batter, smoothing out any lumps but taking care not to deflate the
  batter. Butter 2 rehrucken (saddle of venison) pans (I use one 9x5 loaf
  pan...honestly, how many of us have a rehrucken pan just waiting to be used
  :-) and coat with cornmeal. Pour the batter into the 2 (or one) prepared
  pan(s). Place in a preheated 375 degree oven and bake until a skewer
  inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool on rack and
  unmold while cake is still slightly warm. Sift confectioner's sugar on top,
  if desired.
  
  In the summertime I like to serve a slice of this cake with fresh
  strawberries that have marinated in sugar and balsamic vinegar
  (approximately 1 pint of sliced strawberries mixed with 3 tbs sugar and 1
  tbs balsamic vinegar) and a big dollop of cool whip (yes, I know...it's not
  REAL whipped cream, but I like it anyway!). My husband loves raspberries
  and I am a chocoholic so for Valentine's Day I am going to place a slice of
  cake on a pool of raspberry sauce (frozen raspberries, thawed and then
  placed in the blender with sugar and lemon juice to taste and then strained
  to remove seeds). A dollop of cool whip and a piece of Godiva chocolate on
  the side will complete this lovely desert.
