      <step>  Note: Enough talk about Chili Poppers. Try an Aramdillo Egg!  Its a great
  recipe that I got from the Sept/Oct 1990 issue of Chile Pepper Magazine
  (I've been subscribing for years!) This is still one of my favorite recipes
  from the mag. They suggest Cadillac Bar Poppers as a libation w/your
  Armadillo Eggs.
  
  Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Grate 2 oz. of cheese and set aside. Grate the
  other 6 ozs of cheese and mix it with the sausage and Bisquick. Knead well
  and set aside. Slit and scrape seeds from each jalapeno pepper, leaving the
  stems on. Rinse the jalapenos and stuff each with some of the 2 ozs of
  cheese that was set aside. Separate the sausage dough into patties and form
  around the stuffed pods. Made sure the ends are closed and only the stems
  are showing.
  
  Beat the eggs in a small bowl and set aside. Spread coating mix on a plate.
  Dip each covered pepper into egg and roll in coating mix. Bake on cookie
  sheet for 30 minutes, turning each one over after 15 mintues. Serves 6 as
  appetizer.
