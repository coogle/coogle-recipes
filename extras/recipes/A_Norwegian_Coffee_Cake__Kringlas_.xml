    <directions>
      <step>  Try mixing Vanilla and egg  beat until mixed. Add the Buttermilk and the
  Soda; (I have used 7up) and sift the dry ingredients into this. add the
  rest of the ingredients, mix well. Put the container into the refrigerator
  chill over night. Take out and roll small pieces of the dough into long
  strips, then form them into a figure eight,(like a pretzel) put them back
  into the Refrigerator for about an hour, when they have raised to
  approximately what looks to be the right hight. Bake in a 450 deg
  pre-heated oven for approximately 6 to 8 minutes, ( May vary with the
  weather so keep an eye on them).But they should be a light brown before you
  remove them. Refrigeration is one of the keys of "KRINGLA" making. They
  must be refrigerated in order for them to get the flavor, you could bake
  them without refrigeration but you lose a lot of the flavor. You can also
  use. A:  OATMEAL. B: RAISINS. C: WHOLE WHEAT. You can fill them with your
  favorite filling, Cream Cheese, Jelly, ETC. you don't need eggs or yeast.
  They are not too sweet, and definitely not Boring like a bagel, (Sorry
  Bagel lovers, VBG). It is a coffee Bread not like Muffins, which are too
  sweet, and also do not have too many calories. This recipe came from a
  fella from the town of LOS OSOS CA He is a out of work Carpenter who
  started baking and selling these wonderful Rolls, He said that this is an
  original recipe that he got from his grandmother, (Yea for the Grandmas).
  Ive tried Nuts, and love the cream Cheese one, You could even use Custard
  Filling, Ive also used Different flavored oils like Pure orange oil,
  Butterscotch, several Berries types. and they turned out just great.
