      <step>  Put all this in a huge bowl and mash, knead, squeeze, (see below). Then
  form it into small balls, midway between filbert size and English walnut
  size.  Place on ungreased cookie sheet.  Butter the bottom of a small
  glass, dip it in granulated sugar and mash the balls flat. Keep doing it.
  You need butter the glass bottom only once or twice but re-dip it in sugar
  for each ball.  Then bake at 350 for 10 to 12 minutes. Let them sit just a
  bit before taking up from cookie sheet.
  
  ***** This is a Peg Bracken recipe and Peg stated "However, these are the
  best-tasting as well as the fastest, easiest and cheapest cookies I ever
  ran into and I wouldn't say such a thing unless I meant it. the community
  Mental Health Center at St. Lwarence Hospital in Lansing, Michigan, printed
  it, in the hope of channeling some energies away from throwing bricks, or
  snarling at Santa Claus.  The more you knead, mash, squeeze and beat the
  bejunior out of the dough, the better you feel and the better the cookies
  taste.
