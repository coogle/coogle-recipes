      <step>  Fill up with water to cover veggies. Since I wasn't using a prepared sauce
  as I usually do, I threw in every dried green herb I had in the house:
  oregano, thyme, rosemary, marjoram - about a tsp of each. Mixed well and
  set the crockpot going on low.
  
  This was on Thursday night. On Friday morning I added about a cup of the
  dried Beef-Not and mixed well. By the time we came to eat it the Beef-Not
  was thoroughly cooked and had lost all vestiges of a soy-like taste, and
  the water was well absorbed (a problem sometimes with my cholents).
  
  You can order Beef-Not (and Chicken-Not and heaven knows what else) from
  Dixie Diner's Club by phoning 1-800-BEEF-NOT. I have no affiliation with
  them whatsoever. Watch out - the catalogue has hechshers for many products,
  but I found that one of them didn't have the hechsher on the product when I
  actually ordererd it 8-(.
