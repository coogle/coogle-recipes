    <directions>
      <step>  1. Cut Arab bread into 8 equal wedges. Pull apart each wedges to make 2
  pieces.
  
  2. Arrange as many pieces as you can on cookie sheet. Sprinkle with
  seasonings. Bake at 400F degrees for 5 minutes or until lightly toasted.
  
  *Suggested seasonings--Seasoned salt, lemon pepper, Cajun seasoning,
  Baharat (see recipes).
  
  Serving Ideas : These are great for dipping into Hommus!
  
  NOTES : So easy to make.  Keep bread in freezer; thaw only minutes before
  making chips.  These keep well in a zipper bag for days.
