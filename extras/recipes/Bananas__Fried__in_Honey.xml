      <step>  Cut bananas lenghtwise (peel them first, of course!) and place in non-stick
  frying pan. Add one spoon of honey for each banana (more, if you feel
  emotionally fragile and need lots of sweet). "Fry" at low heat, turning
  sometimes the banana slices so that the melted honey covers them all over.
  It's done when you can't resist looking at the bananas anymore and feel the
  urge to eat them. Add cinnamon.
