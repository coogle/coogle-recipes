  :          A couple friends
  :          Plenty of margaritas
  :          Beer for the guys
        2 lb Ground beef
        1 pk Taco seasoning
        8 oz Sharp cheddar cheese; shred
      1/2    Head of lettuce; cut finely
        2    Tomaotes; chopped up
        1    Onion; chopped fine
        1    Pace picante sauce, HOT
        1 pt Sour cream
        1 pk Unflavored taco chips -OR-
  :          - Taco salad bowls - shells
  :          - to be baked in oven
  
  Number one rule, invite friends over!!! Have a pitcher of margaritas made
  and the beer cold!! Once friends arrive, start the festivities. Put
  everyone to work. Brown the ground beef and drain; add the taco seasoning
  and water according to the packet directions. While doing this, have
  someone else chop the veggies and shred the cheese. If using the taco salad
  bowls, bake them in the oven. If using taco chips, smash them up. While
  working, pour margaritas and beers and take sips every now and then. Supply
  bowls to place all the ingredients in separately. When everything is done
  and ready to go, sit down at table. Make sure everyone has a beer or
  margarita!! Pass everything around and let everyone make their own mess
  (salad). One last important thing - the GUYS get clean up duty!!!
