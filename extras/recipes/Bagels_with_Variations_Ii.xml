    <directions>
      <step>  In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Stir in sugar and salt;
  gradually mix in 4 cups of the flour. Beat well to make a stiff dough.
  
  Turn dough out onto a floured board and knead until smooth and satiny
  (about 10 to 20 minutes), adding flour as needed to prevent sticking -
  dough should be firmer than for most other yeast breads. Place dough in a
  greased bowl; turn over to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place
  until doubled (about 40 minutes).
  
  Punch dough down; knead briefly on a lightly floured board to release air,
  then divide into 18 equal pieces. Form each piece into a smooth ball by
  gently kneading. Holding ball with both hands, poke your thumbs through
  center. With one thumb in the hole, work around perimeter, shaping bagel
  like a doughnut, 2 1/2 to 3 inches across. Place shaped bagels on a lightly
  floured boards, cover lightly, and let stand in a warm place for 20
  minutes.
  
  Bring sugar-water mixture to boiling in a 4 or 5-quart pan; adjust heat to
  keep it boiling gently. Lightly grease 2 baking sheets (at least 12 by 15
  inches) and sprinkle with cornmeal. With a slotted spatula, lift one bagel
  at a time and lower into water; boil 5 or 6 at a time, turning often, for 5
  minutes. Lift out of pan, drain briefly on a towel, and place on baking
  sheet.
  
  Brush bagels with egg yolk mixture. Bake in a preheated 400 F degree oven
  for 25 to 30 minutes or until well browned and crusty. Let cool on a rack.
  
  Makes 18 bagels.
  
  WHOLE WHEAT BAGELS Follow directions for bagels, but omit the 3 tablespoons
  sugar, use 3 tablespoons honey instead. In place of the flour use 2 cups
  whole wheat or graham flour, 1/2 cup wheat germ, and about 2 1/2 cups all-
  purpose flour. Mix in all the whole wheat flour and wheat germ and 1 1/4
  cups of the all-purpose flour before beating dough. Then mix in about 1 1/2
  cups more all-purpose flour; knead and finish as directed.
  
  PUMPERNICKEL BAGELS Follow directions for bagels, but omit the 3
  tablespoons sugar; use 3 tablespoons dark molasses instead. In place of the
  flour use 2 cups rye flour, 2 cups whole wheat flour or graham flour, and
  about 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour. Add all the rye and 1 cup each of the
  whole wheat and all-purpose flour before beating dough. Then add remaining
  1 cup whole wheat and about 3/4 cup more all-purpose flour; knead and
  finish as directed.
  
  OTHER BAGEL VARIETIES Add 1/2 cup instant toasted onion to Bagels or Whole
  Wheat Bagels - add it to yeast mixutre along with the sugar and salt. Or
  sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon poppy seeds or sesame seeds or 1/4 teaspoon coarse
  salt on each glazed bagel before baking. Or add 1 tablespoon caraway seeds
  to Pumpernickel Bagels, then sprinkle each glazed bagel with 1/4 teaspoon
  more caraway seeds before baking.
