      <step>  Sorry I haven't responded earlier. This is in response to your question
  about making the Banana Split Salad for diabetics. My sister is diabetic
  and she has made this so she can eat it. If you think this needs to be
  sweeter you can add Equal or another sweetener. My sister never adds the
  sweetener as she says that it is sweet enough. By the way, I loved your
  idea of adding the crushed pineapple. I'll try it the next time I make this
  salad. Hope this helps! If you have any other questions about it let me
  know. I've also sent the regular version too for anyone who may have missed
  and wants it.
  
  Note 1: my sister washes and drains them so she can eat them as there isn't
  really a substitute -- her nutritionist gave the ok.
  
  Mix together lemon juice, sour cream, and Cool Whip. Add cherries, bananas,
  and nuts. Mix well. Place in Cool Whip containers and freeze. Thaw slightly
  before serving.
