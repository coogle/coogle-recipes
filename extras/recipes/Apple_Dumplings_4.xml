      <step>  To make the baked apples, set a rack at the middle level of the oven and
  preheat to 350 degrees. Peel and core the apples, leaving them whole. Rub
  them all over with the lemon, then place them in the baking pan. Sprinkle
  them with the sugar and cinnamon, making sure that some gets into the
  hollow centers. Stuff the raisins or currants into the centers then place a
  small slice of the butter on each apple.
  
  Bring the preserves and water to a boil in a small pan. Pour around the
  apples in the pan, then immediately place the pan in the oven. After about
  10 minutes, baste the apples every 5 minutes with their juices. The apples
  should take about 30 minutes to bake. They should be tender but not
  disintegrating.
  
  Remove the pan from the oven and place it on a rack to cool. Baste the
  apples with the juices in the pan frequently while they are cooling, then
  cover and refrigerate the apples until they are thoroughly cold, about 2 to
  3 hours. The apples may be prepared up to 2 days before forming and baking
  the pastries.
  
  To form the pastries, remove the apples from the pan and place them on a
  rack over the pan to drain. (Reserve any leftover juices to make a sauce.)
  Set a rack at the middle level of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees.
  
  Place the dough on a floured surface and lightly flour the dough. Roll the
  dough out into a 10 by 18-inch rectangle. Cut the dough into six 5-inch
  squares and place them on the prepared pan. Use a small, round, fluted
  cutter to cut the remaining scrap of dough into 6 small circles.
  
  Brush the squares of dough lightly with egg wash. Place an apple in the
  center of each square. (Replace any raisins or currants that might have
  fallen out of the centers.) Bring each corner of the dough up to the top
  center of the apple. Pinch the seams of the pastry together, then carefully
  brush the outside with the egg wash. Place one of the fluted pastry circles
  on top of each pastry, where the corners join together. Brush the fluted
  dough with egg wash. Bake the pastries about 20 to 25 minutes, until deep
  golden and baked through. Place the pan on a rack to cool slightly before
  you serve the apples.
