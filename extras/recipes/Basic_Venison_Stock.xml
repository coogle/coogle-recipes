      <step>  yields about 1 gallon
  
  Method:  Roast bones and meat on a rack in a roasting pan at 400 degrees
  until well browned - about 40 minutes.  Put celery, carrot and onion on top
  of meat and brown also, another 15 minutes.  When browned, discard fat in
  the pan and put bones, meat, vegetables in a pot large enough to hold
  everything.  Put roasting pan on a stovetop burner over medium heat, pour
  wine into pan and deglaze, scraping any browned residue off pan and add to
  stock pot.  Add water, covering the solids, and remaining ingredients.
  Bring to a gentle boil then cover and reduce heat to a very slow simmer for
  at least six hours, skimming occasionally.  Uncover and simmer for four
  more hours or until reduced to a gallon of liquid. Strain, discarding
  solids and cool, uncovered.  Cover when fully chilled (and not before or it
  may sour).
  
  To make larger batches, just multiply everything except thyme, juniper and
  bay.  For each doubling of all the other ingredients, multiply them by 1
  1/2 or they'll be too strong.
  
  That's the basic stock from which we'll make these two sauces. The first
  one is rich; a good sauce to put on venison no matter how you've cooked it.
  The second is the fullest taste of venison you're ever likely to find, with
  a very deeply concentrated flavor.  This first sauce, Venison Espagnole, is
  what's called "a thickened reduction" and the second, Venison Demi-Glace,
  begins with the first and more of the stock, then goes to a yet further
  reduction.  In each case, flavor is more intensified and developed than in
  the stages before.
