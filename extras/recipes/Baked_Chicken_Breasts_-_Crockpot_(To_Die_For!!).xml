    <directions>
      <step>  Rinse chicken breasts and pat dry; place in Crock-Pot. In a
  saucepan,combine remaining ingredients and heat until smooth and hot. Pour
  over chicken breasts. Cover and cook on low setting for 8 to 10 hours. (I
  did iton higher heat to speed things up. I added boiled potatoes and some
  paprika towards the end.) For the first time ever, I used those frozen
  boneless skinless bags of chicken. NOT BAD! Also, I have never been one to
  cook with canned soups before: have learned my lesson. Once cooked in this
  recipe, you cannot tell there is canned soup as base for sauce. This is
  delish!!!

  NOTES : I think this could be made in oven or on top of stove. Hint:
  Rival's recipe called for 4 ounces of mushrooms, but I doubled the
  quantity.  You could leave them out if you don't like mushrooms. I had no
  Cream of Chicken soup and sub'd Cream of Celery. It was soooooo goooood
  that I think I'll just stick with Celery in the future!!
