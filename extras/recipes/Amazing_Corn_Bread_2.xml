      <step>  Preheat oven to 425f. Grease a pan ( I used a medium vision pot sprayed
  lightly with Pam) and put in oven to preheat. Mix all ingredients, pour
  batter into heated pan and bake for 20 min.
  
  This cornbread was quite moist and flavourful. I'd cut the sugar down or
  out if you were going to serve it with chilli or something like that. It is
  really great hot out of the oven with molasses. (It was the molasses
  discussions that got me thinking about ff corn bread. I have succesfully
  kept in an airtight container over night in the fridge....sorry, it
  doesen't last any longer!
  
  *To make applesauce quick I cut up 1 apple and put in a bowl with a bit of
  water and then microwave on high for about 2 min. Then I use my handblender
  to make it into sauce. Make sure you do this in a tall, thin container as
  it tends to spit up and hot apple sauce really burns! One apple makes about
  1/3 of a cup so you could use storebought for this.
