      <step>  from the book Chocolate Truffles by Carrie Huber.
  
  Making the Ganache: To prepare ganache, chop or grate chocolate into small
  pieces. Place in top half of double boiler along with cream. Put hot (not
  boiling) water in bottom half of a double boiler, making sure the water
  doesn't touch the top pan. Stir often with wooden spoon. When all of the
  chocolate has melted, beat until well combined. Remove from heat, let cool
  to room temperature. Transfer to covered bowl and refrigerate overnight to
  harden. (Ganache will keep in this state for a few days if necessary.)
  
  Take a little ganache at a time and form 1" balls, using fingertips (with
  as little contact as possible so the chocolate doesn't soften). Keep unused
  portion refrigerated as you work. Place balls on waxed paper-lined baking
  sheet; continue until ganache is used up. Refrigerate baking sheet until
  ganache is hardened, overnight or up to two days. Allow to set in
  refrigerator at least two hours before loosely covering with waxed paper.
  Foil can be substituted in all cases for waxed paper, but never use clear
  plastic wrap. It clings too tightly to the candies and traps moisture
  inside which discolors the chocolate. Prepare Chocolate Coating: Chop or
  grate chocolate into small pieces. Heat chocolate and oil together in top
  of double boiler over hot water, stirring until smooth with a wooden spoon.
  Insert candy thermometer and begin dipping the ganache balls when
  temperature registers between 85-90F. If chocolate begins to cool and
  thicken before you're finished dipping, reheat over hot water. Work with
  only 1/2 dozen at a time, keeping the rest refrigerated. Drop a single
  ganache ball into the chocolate, turning to coat well, then lift it with
  the fork. Allow excess chocolate to drip back into pan, then gently rap
  fork against edge of pan to remove more chocolate from ball. Failure to do
  this will cause a large dribbly "platform" or "skirt" to form around the
  base of each hardened truffle. (this makes it difficult to pack them side
  by side in a box.)
  
  There are two schools of thoughts as to the proper method of depositing
  truffles onto the baking sheet: A) If you are conservative by nature it's
  best to gently slide them off the fork with a butterknife, onto the waiting
  baking sheet. B) If you intend to further decorate the truffle, the second
  method, (for the show-offs among us) involves dropping the truffle off the
  fork upside down directly onto the baking sheet. Quickly manipulate the
  single strand of chocolate, adhering to the fork, into some glorious shape
  atop the candy, like the pros do. Either way is acceptable, although the
  second way requires some practice and an accurate thermometer to get it
  right. If your chocolate temperature is off by a few degrees, you're likely
  to find a chocolate highway - not a chocolate strand - adhering to the fork
  when that critical moment comes.
  
  The perfect finale for the basic recipes, for instance, is a sprinkling of
  shaved dark chocolate over the top, or better yet, gently rolling each
  newly-dipped truffle in the shavings to coat completely.
  
  Refrigerate all truffles after dipping several hours or overnight to
  harden.
  
  When ganache has cooled to room temperature, add Amaretto. Roll dipped
  truffle in chopped almonds
