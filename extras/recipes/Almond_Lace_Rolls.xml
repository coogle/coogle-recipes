   These cookies require precision timing and fast action but the results are
  worth the trouble. I make them for holidays and special occasions, but they
  are delicious anytime.
  
   Preheat oven to 350ø. Butter and flour baking sheet.
  
   In a small, heavy pan, place all ingredients. Cook over low heat, stirring
  constantly until butter melts. Drop by teaspoonful: onto baking sheet (do
  not bake more than six at one time).
  
   Bake at 350ø for 7-9 minutes. Cookies should be only slightly brown and
  still bubbling at the center. Let cool only for a minute or so until the
  edge is firm enough to lift with a thin spatula Then, working quickly, lift
  cookies and turn them top side down onto paper towels. Roll over the handle
  of a wooden spoon to get a cylinder shape and let cool until crisp.
  
   Use a fresh cookie sheet for each baking to avoid cookies sticking on
  sheet. If cookies get too firm to roll over the spoon handle, place back in
  the oven for a few moments.
  
   Store cookies in an airtight cookie jar or tin. They will keep for a long
  time, and can be made well ahead of the holiday season.
  
   Variations: These cookies also can be left flat-make them smaller if you
  do that; however, they don't have the flair of the rolled lacy effect. Or
  roll ends of cooled cookies in melted chocolate.
