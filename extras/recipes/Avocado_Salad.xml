      <step>  I just recently joined the Women's Club, and I purchased their cookbooks
  that they had for sale.  I thought it was a great find, because it gave
  some history about the Cocoa Beach area. The cookbooks theme is all about
  space, and the contributors are all related to working at KSC, NASA, or any
  other company having to do with helping put our people into space. I ran
  across several recipes that I thought were interesting or were interesting
  contributors (by virtue of who they were).  If anyone is interested in a
  set of these books, please email me privately. I just love old cookbooks,
  and I am always rumaging (sp) through swap meets and garage sales for some.

  Mash 2 medium sized avocados.  Stir into slightly thickened lemon gelatin
  base, made with gelatin, lemon juice and hot water.  Stir in grapefruit
  sections and chopped celery.  Chill and unmold.  Serve with a whipped cream
  and mayonnaise mixture. (Fresh grapefruit must be thoroughly drained or may
  be difficult to gel)
