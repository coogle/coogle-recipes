      <step>  This recipe was thrown together with odds and bobs in my fridge while my
  children were visiting their father. I enjoyed it so much I made it again
  last night for the children. They loved it and so did a meat-eating friend
  who teases us about our eating habits!
  
  It's relatively quick, very easy, and cheap to make.
  
  1. Preheat oven to 180 deg C
  
  2. Slice the top off each roll.
  
  3. Carefully hollow out each roll. Retain bread crumbs
  
  4. Saute mushrooms, onion, garlic, and chopped herbs in the soy milk until
  onions are soft.
  
  5. Crumble the bread from inside of the rolls into the mushroom mixture.
  
  6. Stir well. You'll find the mixture becomes thick and creamy.
  
  7. Add mustard and seasoning.
  
  8. Spoon the mixture into the rolls, piling it up above the cut surface.
  
  9. Pop the cut top back on the piled mixture.
  
  10. Place the rolls on a baking tray and put them in the oven for about 5
  minutes until the rolls are crisp.
  
  11. Serve with a salad or cooked veggies of your choice.
