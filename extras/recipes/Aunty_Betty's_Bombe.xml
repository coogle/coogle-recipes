    <directions>
      <step>  Whisk 1/2 of the cream until stiff and spread it around the edges of a
  large bowl. Freeze for 1/2 to 1 hour.
  
  Dissolve the sugar in the water, bring to the boil and simmer for 3 minutes
  until syrupy.  Meanwhile, break chocolate into blender or warm bowl.
  
  Pour the hot sugar syrup onto the chocolate and blend or whisk until the
  chocolate has all melted.  Add the egg yolks and mix the whole lot
  thoroughly.
  
  Whisk the remaining cream into soft peaks and fold gently into the
  chocolate mixture. Pour into the centre of the frozen cream and freeze for
  several hours until solid. Cover when fully frozen.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A high-cholesterol chocolate dessert -- This recipe comes from a
  friend's aunt. It always seems to taste wonderful no matter how sloppily I
  measure things. Yield: Serves 4-6.
  
  *  Although the recipe "serves 4-6," two people will happily eat the whole
  thing.
  
  *  The outside is frozen solid, so you may find a fork useful for breaking
  your portion into pieces without showering fellow diners with fragments. It
  could be served in small portions, but don't count on having any left over.
  
  *  Double cream has more than 45 percent butterfat. It is difficult to find
  cream in North America that is richer than whipping cream, which is
  typically 32 percent butterfat. If you can find heavy cream it is likely to
  be 36 percent. Use the richest cream you can find.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 3 hours cooling.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.
