      <step>    This is the result ofJefferson's ingenious mind as an engineer,
  architect, and cook. He developed methods of putting a dough or meringue on
  a bit of ice cream and then baking it. His guests must have been fascinated
  with the things the man of Monticello would develop. He actually invented
  what we now call Baked Alaska.
  
    You can bake this in an oven or you can use a small acetylene torch.
  Don't let the kids try this or you may lose the house!
  
    Have the egg whites at room temperature. Whip in your electric mixer
  along with the cream of tartar. When they form stiff peaks, fold in the
  sugar and vanilla. Frost the ice cream form and bake in a preheated 350Ã¸
  for 10-15 minutes, or until the meringue is lightly browned.
  
    I have much better luck browning the meringue with a hand-held acetylene
  torch.
