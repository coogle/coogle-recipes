    <directions>
      <step>  *cooked and drained 1 very large onion, finely diced This fine dish was
  made by my Aunt Sadie Jean Greenfield Gibrich in the "ol days" before we
  knew what cholesterol was. We used to saute the onion in 1 cup pure
  rendered chicken fat.  Did this taste good!! Look for the fine noodles in
  the Jewish section of your supermarket. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Pam
  Spray 9 x 13 inch pan.  (Pam is Barbara's Saute onion in fat until onion is
  clear&gt; but not brown.  Add to cooked nood along with sour cream, eggs, salt
  and pepper. Transfer to sprayed casserol dish and bake 375 for about 40
  minutes until set and lightly browned on top Good served with brisket of
  beef and sweet &amp; sour red cabbage.
