      <step>  Put 1/2 cup lime in about 1 gallon of boiling water and scald quickly, and
  pull off hair while hot.  Scrape well--remove feet, tail, and
  entrails--like you would a pig.  Cut off ears, remove eyes and head if
  desired.  Pour hot water over it and clean thoroughly.
  
  Put one cup salt in sufficient cold water to cover possum, add 1 pod red
  pepper and let stand overnight.  In the morning remove salt water and pour
  boiling water over it.  Cook in enough boiling water to boil up over possum
  but not enough to cover.  Cook until skin can be pierced with a fork
  easily, and let stand in water until ready for baking.
  
  When ready to bake, place possum in pan with skin side up.  Bake in a
  moderate oven until crisp and brown.  If fire is too hot, skin will blister
  and burn.
  
  Carve possum and surround with potatoes (sliced or quartered) which have
  been previously baked.
