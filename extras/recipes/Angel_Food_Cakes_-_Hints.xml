      <step>  NOTE No one ever made a better angel food cake, than my Mom! It was a
  favorite company dessert, often served with fresh fruit and whipped cream.
  Onolicious!! She followed the directions in her cookbook *exactly*. Me ke

  Here is what her favorite cookbook says about angel food cakes: "True
  sponge cake is leavened solely by air beaten into eggs. White sponge cake,
  or angel food, is made with only whites of eggs. Mock sponge cakes are made
  with baking powder and fewer eggs. Sift flour several times to incorporate
  as much air as possible. Handle flour lightly. Beat the egg whites until
  they are just stiff enough to hold up in peaks. The white piles should look
  moist and glossy. Eggs beaten just to this peaked, glossy stage give the
  best volume and finest grain. More air can be enclosed in egg whites if you
  beat them with a flat wire whisk instead of a rotary beater. Underbeaten
  egg whites makes cake heavy, compact, and undersized because not enough air
  has been incorporated. Overbeaten whites make dry cake of poor volume
  because of loss of air and moisture. Add flavoring to the mixture before
  the flour. It will then be thoroughly blended without the extra folding
  that would be necessary if it were added last. In combining ingredients,
  use only the folding motion. (See paragraph 29.) ** Fold mixture just
  enough to blend ingredients. Undermixing makes uneven grain in cake.
  Overmixing makes the cake heavy, undersized, close-grained, and tough.
  Spread batter evenly in ungreased pan. Cut spatula through batter with a
  circular motion to remove any large air bubbles and to draw batter into
  unfilled spaces."
  
  ** FOLDING is the motion made by gently cutting down through the mixture -
  and curving up and over. This encloses more air and prevents the escape of
  that already beaten into the eggs. Down, up, and over - down, up, and over
  ~ that is the folding motion. It should become a deft, rolling, continuous
  motion so that no time is lost. Use this motion to combine mixtures that
  contain important amounts of air. Source: The Latest Cake Secrets, General
