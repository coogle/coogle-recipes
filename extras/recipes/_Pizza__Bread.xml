      <step>  Place into the bread machine in the order given. Place on dough or pizza
  cycle. Both work well. Remove when finished and shape into a round in a pie
  pan which is oiled. Let rise approximately 30 minutes. For pizza
  bread...put finger holes in top. Rub with olive oil, salt and pepper.
  Bakeat 400 degrees 20-25 minutes. (This produces a flatten bread which I
  believe ended up being named Foccaccio! with some additional toppings.) For
  a loaf of bread, I do the same thing, except that I do not punch holes in
  the top. I lightly rub the top with olive oil...not necessary and bake at
  400 degrees. For pizza....this will yield two pans of thin crust. Top and
  bake this at 425 degrees.
  
  NOTES : This bread is not good baked in the bread machine.
