      <step>  Combine flour and salt in a medium bowl; cut in shortening with a pastry
  blender until crumbly (mixture should have irregular-size pieces).
  
  Sprinkle cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, evenly over surface, and stir
  with a fork until dry ingredients are moistened. (Squeeze dough firmly
  between your fingers after adding 3 tablespoons water; if it falls apart,
  add remaining tablespoon water.)
  
  Shape dough into a flattened disk; wrap in plastic wrap, and chill 2 hours
  or freeze 30 minutes. Let stand at room temperature 5 minutes.
  
  Turn dough out onto a floured surface, and roll to 1/8-inch thickness.
  
  Place in a 9-inch pieplate. Trim off excess pastry along edges; fold edges
  under, and crimp. Prick pastry a few times with a fork if baking. (Do not
  prick if pastry is going to be filled before baking.)
  
  Freeze Bake at 450Â° for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on a
  wire rack. Makes 1 (9-inch) pastry shell.
  
  Notes: This pastry stirs together in 5 minutes, chills in the freezer, and
  is ready to roll in 40 minutes.
