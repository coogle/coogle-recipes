    <directions>
      <step>  Wash the apricots. Cut them in half through the natural indentation and
  remove the pits. Slice each half into 4 lengthwise strips. There should be
  approximately 4 quarts.
  
  Gently combine the apricot slices, sugar, honey, and lemon juice in a large
  nonreactive bowl. Allow to stand at room temperature for 3 to 4 hours,
  stirring several times to keep the fruit coated and to help the juices
  dissolve the sugar.
  
  Pour the fruit mixture into a large 6 quart nonreactive shallow preserving
  pan and bring toa boil over high heat. With a metal spoon or fine mesh
  skimmer, skim off any foam that forms on top. Reduce heat to medium.
  Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, for 20 to 30 minsutes until the
  mixture is thick with a few chunks left and appears slightly glazed.
  
  Turn off the heat and skim any additional foam. Ladle into hot sterilized
  jars, wipe rims clean with a damp towel, and seal with new lids and metal
  rings.Process in a hot-water bath for 5 mins. Remove, cook, check seal,
  label, and store.
  
  Makes 9 cups. Per tablespoon: 23 calories; trace fat
