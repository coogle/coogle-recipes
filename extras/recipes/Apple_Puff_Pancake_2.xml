      <step>  Melt butter in a 9- or 10-inch microwavable pie pan. Combine 3 tablespoons
  sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle on melted butter. Arrange apple slices over
  this mixture.
  
  Cook in microwave oven on high for 2 minutes; cool slightly.
  
  Beat eggs, milk and flour and remaining 1 tablespoon sugar plus a dash of
  salt until smooth. Pour over apple mixture and bake at 400Â° F for 15 to 20
  minutes until puffy and nicely browned. Serves 4.
  
  NOTES : Each time Laurie "innsat" for us she would leave the menus she had
  prepared for breakfast and I kept seeing this "Apple Puff Pancake" on her
  list.  Finally I asked her about this recipe and she shared it with me.  I
  use it often and it is always well received.  In her other life, Laurie is
  an outstanding seventh grade language arts teacher.
