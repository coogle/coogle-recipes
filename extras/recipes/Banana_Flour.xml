      <step>  Slice and dry full grown bananas. Use only the fruit that is full grown as
  green bananas contain too much starch. After drying, grind or pound in a
  mortar, then pass the powder through a sieve. This flour can be used in
  equal parts with regular flour in making desserts where a starchy substance
  is used.
