      <step>  Cut off the woody stems of asparagus. If stalks are thick, peel with a
  vegetable peeler, pulling from stem end toward tip. (Thin spears do not
  need peeling.) In a large skillet, bring about 1-inch of salted water to a
  boil. Add asparagus and boil gently, uncovered, until tender, about 3 to 6
  minutes after water comes to a boil. Timing depends on size and age of
  spears. Drain. If not serving immediately, run under cold water with ice to
  stop the cooking. Before serving, reheat in microwave for 2 to 3 minutes or
  until hot. In a small skillet, melt butter over medium high heat. Add
  almonds and saute, stirring, until butter is dark brown and almonds are
  golden. Season with salt to taste. Before serving, spoon almonds and butter
  over asparagus. vance Prep: Asparagus and almond butter may be refrigerated
  separately overnight. Reheat both before serving. Prep Time: 10 minutes
  Cook Time: 3 to 6 minutes Makes: 6 to 8 servings
