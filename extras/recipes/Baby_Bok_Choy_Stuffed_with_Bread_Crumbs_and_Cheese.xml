    <directions>
      <step>  Place the bread crumbs on a plate and toss with 1 tablespoon of oil.
  Microwave on high( 100 percent power) for 2 minutes, stirring after 1
  minute, or until toasted. Rinse the bok choy; set aside the four largest,
  and finely chop the remaining two. In a small bowl, with a fork mix
  together the ricotta cheese, lemon peel, remaining 1 tablespoon oil,
  chopped bok choy and bread crumbs. Gently spread apart the leaves of each
  whole bok choy and fill with the cheese mixture. Place in single layer in a
  dish, cover, and microwave on high for 4 minutes, or until wilted and
  slightly soft. Serve right away or at room temperature. Typos by Brenda

  NOTES : Looking like. a small, leafy nosegay with pearly, lettuce-like
       branches spreading from a core,baby bok choy is a cabbage. Until
       recently it
       was known only to Chinese grocers and cooks, but its appeal has
       spread, and
       many supermarkets now carry the vegetable. It has two great
       advantages: It
       steams whole to beautifully decorate a party plate and in the
       microwave, it
       speeds to such a rapid crunchy doneness, you scarcely turn around
       and it's
       ready. It can be simply wilted and buttered, oiled, sauced with
       soy, or
       included in a stir-fry.
