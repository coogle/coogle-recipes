      <step>  The allied recipes for this rather complex operation follow in the
  next post. Although this dish can be baked in an oven, I strongly
  suggest you grill it over charcoal, for the result is far superior.
  The dish may be prepared over 2 consecutive days.  On day one,
  prepare the dipping sauce and condiments.  The Vegetable Platter and
  shrimp paste can be assembled the following day. Fresh sugar cane may
  be obtained at Caribbean markets; canned sugar cane is available at
  Asian grocery stores. Prepare the roasted rice powder, scallion oil,
  crisp-fried shallots and roasted peanuts. Set aside. Shell and devein
  the shrimp. Sprinkle the salt over the shrimp and let stand for 20
  minutes.  Rinse the shrimp thoroughly with cold water. Drain and
  squeeze between your hands to remove excess water.  Dry thoroughly
  with paper towels.  Coarsely chop the shrimp. Boil the pork fat for
  10 minutes.  Drain and finely dice. In a food processor, combine the
  shrimp, garlic, shallots and sugar. Process until the shrimp paste
  pulls away from the sides of the container, stopping as necessary to
  scrape down the sides.  The paste should be very fine and sticky. Add
  the pork fat, roasted rice powder, fish sauce and black pepper to
  taste to the processor. Pulse briefly, only enough to blend all of
  the ingredients. Cover and refrigerate. Meanwhile, prepare the Peanut
  Sauce and Vegetable Platter. Cover the rice papers with a damp towel
  and a sheet of plastic wrap; keep at room temperature until needed.
  Peel the fresh sugar cane; cut crosswise into 4-inch sections. Split
  each section lengthwise into quarters. (if using canned sugar cane,
  split each section lengthwise in half only, then thread 2 pieces
  lengthwise onto a skewer.) Pour about 1/4 cup of oil into a small
  bowl.  Oil your fingers. Pick up and mold about 2 tablespoons of the
  shrimp paste around and halfway down a piece of fresh sugar cane.
  Leave about 1 1/2 inches of the sugar cane exposed to serve as a
  handle. (If using canned sugar cane, there is no need to leave a
  handle. The skewers will serve as handles.) Press firmly so that the
  paste adheres to the cane. Proceed until you have used all the shrimp
  paste. Prepare a charcoal grill or preheat the oven to broil.
  Meanwhile, steam the noodles, then garnish with the scallion oil,
  crisp-fried shallots and ground roasted peanuts. Keep warm.  Pour the
  peanut sauce into individual bowls and place the Vegetable Platter
  and rice papers on the table. Grill the shrimp paste on the sugar
  cane over medium coals, turning frequently. Or Broil, on a baking
  sheet lined with foil, under the broiler, about 6 inches from the
  heat, for 3 minutes on each side, or until browned. Transfer to a
  warm platter. To serve, each diner dips a rice paper round in a bowl
  of warm water to make it pliable, then places the paper on a dinner
  plate.  Different ingredients from the Vegetable Platter, some
  noodles and a piece of the shrimp paste, which has been removed from
  the sugar cane, are added.  The rice paper is then roiled up to form
  a neat package.  The roll is dipped in the Peanut Sauce and eaten out
  of hand. The remaining sugar cane may be chewed. Note: If both types
  of sugar cane are unavailable, use skewers.  Shape the shrimp paste
  into meatballs and thread 3 or 4 on each skewer. Yield: 4 to 6
  servings. From "The Foods of Vietnam" by Nicole Rauthier. Stewart,
  Tabori &amp; Chang. 1989. Posted by Stephen Ceideberg; May 24 1993.
