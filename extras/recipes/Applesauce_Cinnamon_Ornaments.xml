  Mix together in an electric mixer for about 5 minutes until the dough looks
  like clay. It will be smooth and not very sticky. Dust hands with cinnamon
  to be able to handle the dough. Dust a rolling pin and board with cinnamon
  and roll out to about 1/4 an inch thick or more. (thinner dough than this
  tends to curl during baking) Cut out with holiday cookie cutters.
  
  Bake on an ungreased cookie sheet at 150 degrees for one hour. Remove from
  the cookie sheets and bake on the oven racks for another hour and a half.
  
  Decorate with fabric paints, candy-shaped beads, silk holly, or whatever
  you want. Hot glue a ribbon or a small magnet to the back, or hot glue
  several to a ribbon wrapped grapevine wreath. (Ho, Ho, Ho)
