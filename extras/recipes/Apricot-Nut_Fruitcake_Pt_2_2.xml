      <step>  full. Bake in the preheated oven 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours for a 9- or 10- inch
  tube cake, about 1 hour and 15 minutes for baby loaves, until the cake
  top(s) aree golden brown (cracking is normal as the steam escapes) and a
  cake tester inserted in the center shows no visible raw batter. Cool each
  cake on a wire rack for 20 minutes. Run a knife blade around the cake sides
  to loosen, then top with a cardboard cake disk or plate and invert; remove
  the pan and peel off the paper. Invert again and cool the cake completely,
  right side up. Once cold, the cakes may be served or stored.
  
  If you wish, wrap the cold cakes in plastic wrap, then in foil, and
  refrigerate them for a week or two for the flavors to mellow, then serve or
  freeze. Do not wrap this cake with alcohol-soaked cloths for storage. Of
  course, it is also fine to eat the cake right after baking. Before serving,
  brush the cake top with Apricot Glaze or Icing Glaze and set a few halved
  nuts and cut pieces of apricot into the soft glaze. Allow about 30 minutes
  for the glaze to set.
  
  Apricot Glaze: Stir preserves over medium heat in a small saucepan until
  melted. Stir and cook about 2 minutes longer, bringing preserves to a boil.
  Cook until thick enough to coat a spoon. Strain preserves through a sieve.
  Cool slightly and use pastry brush to coat the cake with lukewarm glaze.
  Chill cake to set the glaze.
  
  Firm Apricot Glaze: This recipe is preferred when a glazed cake top must be
  held several hours before serving. The addition of gelatin keeps the glaze
  from melting.
  
  Stir preserves over medium heat in a small saucepan until melted. Strain
  preserves through sieve. Remove solids, then return strained preserves to
  saucepan. Add gelatin and liqueur. Stir over medium heat until gelatin
  completely dissolves. Bring to a boil for barely 30 seconds, then cool
  slightly. Apply lukewarm glaze to cake. Chill cake to set glaze.
  
  Basic Icing Glaze: Enough for one 9-inch tube cake. Double recipe for
  10-inch tube cake.
  
  Combine all ingredients in a small bowl, beat well, and check flavor and
  consistency. Add more cream to thin, more sifted sugar to thicken the
  glaze. It should drip from a spatula in a sheet when at correct
  consistency.
  
  Recipe is from _A Piece of Cake_ by Susan G. Purdy.
