    <directions>
      <step>  Combine milk and egg yolks.  Sift together dry ingredients and add to
  milk/egg mixutre.  Beat egg whites until stiff and fold into mixture. Heat
  aebleskiver pan and put about 1 tsp oil in each cup of the pan. when very
  hot, pour enough batter in each cup to almost fill it. Use knitting needle
  (or any pointed tool) to turn aebleskivers. Keep turning them until golden
  brown.  Add shortening as needed for each new batch. Makes about 3 dozen.
  
  This recipe was a huge hit at my summer beach house -- we had it every
  Saturday!  We top them with powdered sugar, fresh berries, and whipped
  cream.
  
  Good luck finding the pans -- mine was a gift.  I later found one more at a
  discount cooking store at the shore. However, this year I searched the
  shore and the Washington area and have yet to find another. The store
  managers of the discount places say they never know what they are going to
  get.   Since my first one came from some catalogue (they don't even sell
  them anymore!) you might try calling a very high end cookware store and
  seeing if they can order you one. The pans are cast-iron, so you'd need a
  distributor of cast-iron cookware. (Hmm -- you could also check the
  manufacturer of whatever is in the stores and call the company directly.)
  Let me know if you have any success.
  
  By the way -- I started making these because my husband is Dutch, and
  Holland considers aebleskivers ~- which they call "Poffritches" -- a great
  delicacy!
