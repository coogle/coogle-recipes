  Mix the semolina and salt together. On a large work surface, form a mound
  with the semolina and create a "well" in the center of the mound. In a
  small bowl, beat the eggs and oil together until smooth. Pour this mixture
  into the well. Working from the inside of the well out, gradually work the
  semolina into the eggs, until all the flour is worked in. Wrap with plastic
  and allow to rest for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove from the refrigerator and
  temper for 5 minutes. Flour a surface and turn the dough out onto it. Roll
  out the dough to 1/2-inch thick. Cut the dough out into thirds. Using a
  pasta machine, wide cutters, carefully work one piece of the pasta dough
  through the pasta machine. Lightly toss the cut pasta in flour to prevent
  from sticking. Pass the remaining pieces of pasta through the machine.
  Bring a pot of salt water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook for about 3 to
  4 minutes or until the pasta is tender. Drain and toss the pasta with olive
  oil, salt and pepper. Serve warm.
  
  Yield: 1 pound of pasta/4 servings
