      <step>  I checked this great little book out of the library a couple days ago. It's
  called Simple Soups by Teresa Kennedy. Here are a few examples of her great
  sounding recipes!
  
  Place the walnuts and garlic in aa food processor or blender with 2 or 3
  tablespoons of the broth. Process 1 to 2 minutes or until the mixture forms
  a paste. Remove the paste to a med-size saucepan and whisk in the remaining
  broth, a little at a time, until the mix is smooth. Bring to a boil over
  med heat. Add the cream and cont cooking, stirring constantly, until the
  soup is heated through. Do not allow it to boil. Season to taste with salt
  and pepper. Serves 4
