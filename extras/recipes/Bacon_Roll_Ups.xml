    <directions>
      <step>  Remove crust from bread and reserve for another use Arrange 1 slice of
  cheese on each slice of bread Gently roll each of the the bread/cheese into
  a tube (you will need to press on the bread to help it roll well and hold
  together) Starting at one end of bread/cheese roll...wrap the bacon slice
  around the roll overlapping slightly as you roll up. Try to cover the
  entire surface of the bread Broil from 8 to 12 minutes turning for equal
  browning Cool slightly to touch
  
  This little tid bit goes real well with soup and can be re-heated.
