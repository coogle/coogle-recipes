    <directions>
      <step>  Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350
  degrees. Lightly butter a 9" springform pan. Dust pan
  with flour and tap out excess. In top of double boiler
  over hot, not simmering water, melt together espresso
  and chocolate, stirring occasionally. Remove pan from
  heat and cool until tepid. In large bowl, using
  hand-held electric mixer set at medium high speed,
  cream sugar and butter together until light and
  fluffy. One at a time, add egg yolks to mixture,
  beating well after each addition. Beat in flour. In
  large grease-free bowl, using hand-held mixer at
  medium high speed, beat egg whites until they form
  stiff, shiny peaks. Fold 1/4 of the whites into
  chocolate mixture to lighten. Then fold in remaining
  whites. Fold in butter and flour mixture. Scrape
  batter into prepared pan and bake 60 to 70 minutes or
  until top is crusty and cracked and the middle is
  still slightly moist. Remove cake to wire rack to cool
  completely. Remove sides of springform pan and
  transfer cake to serving plate. If desired, place
  doily on top of cake and sprinkle with confectioners
  sugar. Remove doily to form pattern.
