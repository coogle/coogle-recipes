    <directions>
      <step>  1.  Trim the excess fat from the chicken pieces, but leave at least some of
  the skin on.  I personally like the taste of chicken skin, but I can
  understand wanting to remove it for health reasons. Compromise--leave just
  a little bit on!  Place in a bowl with the rice wine and vinegar. Let
  marinate for at least 30 min.
  
  2.  Lay a piece of foil over the bottom of a baking dish. Grease the
  surface of the foil, and lay a bed of mint leaves on top of it. Use only
  enough so that the chicken will neat little bed to lay upon!
  
  3.  Cut the red onion into coarse pieces.  Sprinkle loosely on top of the
  mint leaves.  Sprinkle some salt over the onion and mint.
  
  4.  Peel the garlic cloves, and cut each in half. Take the chicken out of
  the marinade and sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper to taste. Place
  the pieces on top of the mint and onions. Take the garlic pieces and place
  them between chicken pieces (or even on top, if you like!)
  
  5.  Bake in a 350 degree oven for around 30 min. (depending on how much
  chicken you used), or until fully cooked. Fully cooked means that when you
  poke a knife next to the bone, there won't be any bright red blood running
  out.  Turn chicken pieces over once during baking. When done, turn the oven
  onto broil and broil the chicken, skin side up, for about 5 min., or until
  skin is lightly brown.
  
  Serve with rice!  The mint and onions soak up a lot of nice flavor, and the
  garlic turns out slightly roasted and soft. I like to pour a little soy
  sauce and sesame oil on top of my rice with this dish, but that's just me.
