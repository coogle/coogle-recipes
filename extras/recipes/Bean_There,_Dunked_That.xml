      <step>  In our local newspaper there was a piece about a new cookbook,
  *Looneyspoons* by Janet and Greta Podleski. Low fat, but really not low
  enough for this group, at least in the recipes they shared, but could be
  easily adapted I think. Also there are meat based recipes in the book. The
  following is something I'm going to try, adjusting for fatfree.
  
  Combine all ingredients in a blender or food processor and process until
  smooth. Chill for at least 1 hour before serving. Serve with pita. Makes 1
      1/2    cups.
  
  Comments from the authors: *This recipe is a creamy, garlicky dip made of
  lean beans that is similar to hummus, but lower in fat. and make it once
  and everyone will be begging you to make it again, it is a recipe that
  really gets around.*

  I believe this is acceptable for this list with the adaptions *starred and
  it is a bit different from other bean dips I've seen on this list,
  especially the coriander.
