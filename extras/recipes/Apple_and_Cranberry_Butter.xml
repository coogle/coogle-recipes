    <directions>
      <step>  occasionally for the first hour or so; covered. Then remove cover and turn
  down to low and stir occasionally. This is a slow process since you have
  NOT precooked the apples.  Will take 36 or MORE hours. You may have to use
  MORE or LESS of the juices depending on the tartness (or sweetness) of the
  fruit. You can cook during the night but I usually do not. I usually put
  the entire inset in the fridge.
  
  CANNING:  You can process this in a water bath but I usually just keep it
  in the fridge; it never lasts that long.
  
  NOTE:  It is the evaporation of the liquid that thickens and sweetens this
  'butter'. After initial cooking with lid; REMOVE lid of the crockpot during
  the cooking and keep it on LOW!  Stir to break up the skin. You may have to
  use a hand held blender to get it smooth..or ZAP in the Food Processor.
