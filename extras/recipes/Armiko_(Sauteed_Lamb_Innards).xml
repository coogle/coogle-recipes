      <step>  Pierce the liver with a knife, cut open the heart and fry them together in
  a little hot oil for a few minutes.  Pass them with the kidneys through a
  coarse grinder.  In Greece we would also use the lungs - but in NY it is
  against the health code to sell them.
  
  Heat 4 tablespoons olive oil in a heavy frying pan and saute the onions
  until transparent.  Add the meat, dill parsley, and salt and pepper. Stir
  in well and saute gently for 15 minutes. Add a little water to moisten and
  cook until the meat is tender. Remove from the heat and sprinkle with
  chopped walnuts. Serve warm or cold.
  
  Serves 4-6.
  
  NOTES: A traditional Sephardic recipe.
  
  This fufills the injunction in the Torah:
  
  And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire and unleavened
  bread; with bitter herbs they shall eat it. Eat not of raw, nor sodden at
  with water, but roast with fire; its head with its legs and all of the
  innards thereof. And ye shall leave none of it remaining until morning.
  
  Exodus XII 8-11
  
  My guests did well - except for the head.
