      <step>  Beat the egg.  Don't let your neighbours find out, though. Mix everything
  together.  Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
  
  Place blobs of cookie dough on a greased cookie sheet in the size you like,
  and flatten with a fork to make the traditional peanut-butter cookie
  pattern. Put in oven and bake for 8-10 minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  These are very simple peanut-butter cookies -- They turn out a little
  moist, but are yummy.
  
  *  These cookies are a bit moist, so don't worry about that. Don't burn
  them; they don't taste good when they're burnt.
