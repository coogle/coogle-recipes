  In a small bowl, soften yeast in water for 10 minutes.  Stir well.
  
  In a 2- quart bowl, combine flour and sugar. Mix thoroughly or the flour
  will lump when the milk is added. Slowly stir in warm milk and softened
  yeast mixture. Cover loosely and let stand at room temperature until
  bubbly. Refigerate. Consider this day 1 of the 10 day cycle.
  
  Day 2 through 4: Stir with a spoon (any kind)
  
  Day 5 To feed, blend flour and sugar in a small bowl; slowly mix in milk
  with a spoon,whisk or hand mixer.  Stir mixture into starter. Return to
  refrigerator.
  
  Day 6 through 9: Stir
  
  Day 10 ( which becomes Day 1 for the next series) Feed again.
  
  Note: Consider the 10-day cycle a guide; it does not have to be followed
  exactly. If you need more starter, feed it more often. The starter is a
  yeast culture and will grow when fed. To hasten growth, leave starter at
  room temp for several hours.
  
  After feeding the starter, Choose from among the following:
  
  1. Return starter to refrigerator.
  
  2. Remove what you need for baking and leave it at room temperature until
  very bubbly. Return remainder to refrig- erator and continue to follow the
  10-day cycle. If yoy are getting to much, cut the "food" in half on one
  feeding. Don't let starter drop below 1 cup, because rejuvenating it to
  usable amounts takes several days.
  
  3. Measure out 1 cup lots to give to friends or put in the freezer.
  
  4. Frozen starter takes at least 3 hours at room temperature to thaw and
  come to life.
