    <directions>
      <step>  Cut off the wingtips from the duck and wrap them up
  with the giblets for making stock.  Pull out and
  discard any loose interior fat. Rinse the duck inside
  and out and pat dry, inside and out. Mix together in a
  spice mill or mortar the peppercorns, thyme, bay
  leaves, cloves and salt. Grind to a fine texture.
  Combine in a small dish with the brown sugar and
  brandy. Place the duck in a heavy plastic bag that
  fits snugly. Rub half the spice mixture inside the
  duck and the remaining half over the outside. Place
  the garlic in the duck's cavity. Close the bag tightly
  and refrigerate 24 hours, rubbing the surface and
  squeezing in the spices occasionally. Remove the duck
  from the bag and gently pat it dry. Set it on a cake
  rack over a plate and return it, uncovered, to the
  refrigerator for another 24 hours or so, turning it
  once. Pat the duck to dry it thoroughly (if not
  already dry) and let it come to room temperature (at
  least two hours). Preheat the oven to 300. Using a
  large needle and white cotton thread, sew closed the
  neck and tail openings.  Place the duck on its side on
  a rack set in a roasting pan. Roast the duck for 45
  minutes. With the needle, prick the fatty parts on the
  upper side; do not prick deeply enough to pierce the
  flesh. Grab the duck by the legs and turn it over onto
  the other side. Increase the oven temperature to 350
  and roast 30 minutes. Price the fatty parts on the
  upturned side and then turn the duck onto its breast.
  Increase the heat to 400 and roast about 30 minutes
  longer, or until the duck is deeply browned and most
  of the fat has melted away. Remove from the oven and
  let cool 1 to 3 hours before serving. To serve: Using
  a heavy cleaver or poultry shears, cut through flesh
  and bone of the duck carefully to make about 12 to 14
  serving pieces, keeping the skin neatly intact on each
  piece. Spread the cabbage leaves over a platter,
  shallow basket or wooden bowl and arrange the duck on
  them. If the duck is to be served hot, arrange the cut
  pieces in a pan in a single layer, cut side down, and
  roast in a preheated 350 oven 15 minutes.
