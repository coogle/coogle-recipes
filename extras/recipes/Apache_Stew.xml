      <step>  Roast the peppers, then peel, seed, and cut into long strips.  Roast the
  chiles, then peel, seed, devein and dice.
  
  Heat the oil in a large stew pot over medium-high heat.  When the oil is
  almost smoking, add the venison and cook until the meat is lightly browned,
  3 to 5 minutes.  Add the onion and garlic and saute 2 minutes more.
  
  Stir in the carrots, peppers, and chiles and cook 1 minute more.  Add the
  hominy, water, salt, and pepper and bring the mixture ot a boil. Reduce the
  heat to low and let the stew simmer 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally to
  prevent burning, until the meat is very tender.  Just before serving, add
  the tumbleweed greens, stir 1 minute and spoon into bowls. *****
  
  The Apache people lived in many regions throughout southeastern Arizona and
  New Mexico.  The men hunted the animals that roamed the mountains, and the
  women gathered and harvested both wild foods and the foods that they
  cultivated on the land.
  
  This recipe is based on a traditional stew that was taught to me by a San
  Carlos medicine man during one of my visits to his ranch.  When I prepare
  the stew now, I can vividly remember the tapping of his traditional water
  drum and the songs he chanted in his native Apache tongue. Through his
  songs, he asked for all people to walk in harmony with Mother Earth and be
  guided by the spirit of the mountains and the spirit of his drum. I still
  remember the sincerity and yearning of his songs.
  
  Depending on what type of produce was available, the ingredients added to
  the venison varied each time the stew was prepared.  This recipe includes
  the basics of the stew, but you can substitute other vegetables.
