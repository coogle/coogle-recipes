      <step>  This month, we're delighted to bring you a quick and easy recipe for
  bannock, from James' latest cookbook, Peasant's Alphabet.
  
  Bannock is a non-rising bread that goes back to the days of the trappers,
  hunters and covered wagon pioneers. They all made bannock at the end of a
  long day when they were cold, tired and hungry.
  
  Serve this delicious bread on a cold winter's night, alongside a steaming
  pot of chili or a big hearty stew. You may want to recruit the youngsters
  into helping you. After all, it's a great introduction to cooking andit's
  just messy enough to make it enjoyable.
  
  Next time you're baking -- whether you're using a conventional oven, a
  barbecue or even an open fire -- try out this recipe for bannock.
  
  MIX the flour, salt, baking powder and sugar together in a bowl.
  
  ADD the oil and milk (or water), stirring until you have a stiff batter.
  
  DUST your hands with the flour and press the batter into a flat cake about
  1/2 an inch / 1.25 cm thick.
  
  POKE a hole in the middle (so it looks like a big donut).
  
  HEAT a lightly greased frying pan over high heat for 1 minute, then turn it
  to low.
  
  PLACE the bannock in the pan, cover and cook for 5 minutes.
  
  FLIP, cook for 5 more minutes and then cook a further 10 minutes on each
  side (cook about 35 minutes altogether).
  
  EAT immediately with lots of butter and jam or peanut butter.
