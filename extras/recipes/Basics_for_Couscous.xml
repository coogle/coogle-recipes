        <title>LAMB COUSCOUS WITH 7</title></ing-div></ingredients>
    <directions>
      <step>  There must be seven vegetables, never fewer - usually onion, carrot, green
  peppers, courgettes, turnip, white cabbage, aubergine. An eighth is
  essential, tomato.
  
  The lamb, too, is crucial. Tender 2 month old lamb is best, because it is
  tender. It is skinny. It has no fat, but is has the flavour of the herbs it
  feeds on, thyme, rosemary, wild fennel.
  
  Basically, everything cooks in the pot for an hour, but the hard vegetables
  go in first and the tender vegetables for the last 20 minutes. That's it.
  It cooks at a rolling boil, and there's the rub. For the last half hour,
  the couscous has to be cooked in a colander above it, where it steams.
  
  We have problems trying to mimic this. For a start, we can't buy the
  quality of couscous he uses; one which readily takes on the flavours of the
  stew steaming underneath, and absorbs a certain amount of butter.
  
  Most couscous sold in Britain, and France too, is pre-cooked, so follow the
  instructions on the packet. (Note, if it is too robustely steamed it will
  cook to a mush suitable only for invalids.) But for interest, should you be
  able to obtain authentic grain, this is how he cooks it. (Middle Eastern
  shops should stock it. It has a gutsy texture and character.)
  
  This is what Monsieur Boujeema Mars, eminent chef des cuisines, La
  Mamounia, Marrakech, Morrocco, does: There are three stages. He wets 12
  ounces of couscous with one cup of water only. He lines a colander (which
  fits over his stew pan) with muslin, and put the couscous inside. Using the
  muslin, he ensures a tight seal between pan and colander. He places the lid
  loosely on top and steams the couscous for 10 minutes. He removes the
  colander, stirs in a knob of butter, adds another cup of water, and steams
  it a further ten minutes. He repeats the process a third time, making the
  cooking time 30 minutes in all.
