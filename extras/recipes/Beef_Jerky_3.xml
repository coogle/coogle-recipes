    <directions>
      <step>  Trim off all the fat and silverskin from the roast. Cut 1/8-inch the meat
  into 1/8-inch slices. Separate roast into it's natural sections before
  slicing results it meat pieces about the right size. Mix the smoke
  flavoring, soy sauce, sugar, garlic, pepper, and chiles and let stand for 5
  minutes. Then place in a bowl with a tight seal big enough for the marinade
  and cut meat; let stand 10 minutes for flavors to develop. Layer meat in
  the bowl so that each side gets coated with marinade and cover tightly. Let
  stand about 10 minutes, shaking bowl and inverting every few minutes to
  cover all pieces evenly. Longer marinating does not change the flavor.
  Drain meat in sieve or colander and place in single layers on the
  dehydrator trays. (Takes about 7 trays for 5 pounds of meat.) Dry according
  to your dehydrator instructions. Enjoy.
  
  NOTES : I prefer top round because of the large clear sections of meat,
  however, almost any cut will do if you trim the meat well. This marinade
  also works well with fish and turkey.
