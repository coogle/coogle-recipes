      <step>   Legend has it that bakers started making pastry in the form of crescents
  following the Turkish siege of Vienna in 1683.
  
   Preheat oven to 350Ã¸.
  
   In a large bowl, mix flour, sugar and ground walnuts. Make a little well
  in the flour mixture and add the egg yolks. Cut butter into small pieces
  and add to the flour mixture. Knead thoroughly and shape into a ball. Add
  flour, if needed, to prevent the dough from sticking to the bowl.
  
   Cut the ball in 4 parts and shape each part in a roll about inch thick.
  Cut 1/4-inch pieces and form small crescents in the palm of your hand.
  Place crescents on a greased baking sheet and bake about 9-10 minutes,
  until light brown.
  
   While still warm, roll the crescents in the confectioners sugar (be
  careful, they break very easily), then place them on a board to cool. Store
  in a cookie tin. The flavor actually improves with time.
  
  Yield: about 3 dozen. Franziska Mayer, Washington, DC
