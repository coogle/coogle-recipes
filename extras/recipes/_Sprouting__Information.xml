       You can purchase a sprouting jar (available at most health food
  stores) or you can make your own. To make your own get a 1/2 gallon clear
  glass container. Be sure to wash it out well. Cover the mouth with a fine
  screen and use a rubber band to keep it on. That's it. Really though, the
  purchased jars are inexpensive and are made just for the purpose.
  
  ** How to sprout seeds
  
  1.) Place measured amount of seed, beans, or grain into sprouting jar. Add
  water and soak overnight following chart recommendations below.
  
  2.)  Pour off soak water and place jar mouth down at 45 degree angle for
  drainage and ventilation between rinsings, then rinse twice a day with
  fresh cool water.
  
  3.)  After sprouts have matured (see chart below) place them in a bowl of
  water. Seed hulls will float to the top and dprouts will sink. Skim hulls
  off with your hand and discard them. Gently remove sprouts from bowl and
  drip drain before storing them in a glass or plastic (closed) container or
  bag in the refridgerator.
  
  4.)  Place Alfalfa, Mustard, Cabbage, Clover, and Radish in indirect light
  for two days before harvesting to develop chlorophyll. Use the sprouts in
  preparing your next meal, in salads and sandwiches.
  
  ** Sprouting tip
  
     The ideal sprouting temperature is between 65~ and 75~. Sprouts grow
  best in darkness or indirect light. When sprouted too long some seeds and
  beans may become bitter. Grains become sweeter on the fourth and fifth day
  of sprouting. Start new seeds every 3 days for a continuous suppy.
