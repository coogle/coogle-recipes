      <step>  Take one regular sized can of applesauce and add enough cinnamon to make a
  dough.  Roll out and cut into shapes then bake in a VERY slow oven say 150
  to 250 until completely dry. Let them air dry over night before using. If
  you are going to use for hanging ornaments punch a hole in the top with a
  straw(drinking kind). This recipe used a lot of cinnamon so drain the
  applesause first then add the spice. You can use any spice, apple pie or
  pumpkin pie spice are nice too. So is a little nutmeg added to the
  cinnamon.
