  For the dough: Put the water in a mixing bowl and sprinkle the yeast over
  it. Stir until the yeast has dissolved. Beat the egg into the yeast
  mixture, and set aside.
  
  Sift together the flour, sugar, and salt. Add the yeast mixture.  Knead
  until the mix forms a ball- if too moist add a bit more flour.  Knead 10
  minutes more.
  
  Roll out to an 11" square. Spread 1/2 cup butter over the surface of the
  dough. Fold the dough into thirds and wrap in a damp cloth.  Refrigerate 20
  minutes. Repeat this process beginning from rolling out the dough, two more
  times.
  
  While the dough is in the refrigerator the last time, you should prepare
  the fillings, icings or other recipes you will need for the finished
  pastries.
  
  The following parts will give you the variety of pastries made with this
  dough, and the methods. They will be followed by additional recipes needed
  to prepare the pastries. Source: Vera Stevens (my mother)
  
  INSTRUCTIONS FOR WEINERBROD: Place the dough on a lightly floured board and
  cut it in half. Roll each piece into 24" X 6" strip. Spread the surface
  with Almond butter. Fold the edges lengthwise toward the center, allowing
  1" space in the center. Sprinkle the plumped currants and spoon the Vanilla
  Cream into the 1" space between the edges. Repeat with second strip. Place
  both lengths of dough on a baking sheet and shape strips together like a
  giant pretzel, tucking in the ends. Brush with the egg wash and sprinkle
  with almonds. Allow the dough to rise 1 hour in a cool room. When light,
  bake 35 minutes in a 375 degree F. oven. (or, if making small pastries,
  10-12 minutes) Cool and ice. Cut in 3" pieces. This makes 1 large pastry or
  24 small ones. See later parts for necessary fillings and icings.
  
  INSTRUCTIONS FOR SPANDAUER: Requires Your favorite jelly.  Place the dough
  on a floured board and cut it in half. Roll each half 1/4" thick Cut into
  4" squares. Spread Almond butter on each square. Sprinkle plumped currants
  or raisins on top. Fold corners to center. Put a bit of your favorite jelly
  in the center. Spoon Vanilla Cream in center. Place 2" apart on baking
  sheet. Brush with egg wash. Let rise till puffy. Brush again with the egg
  wash. Bake at 375 degrees F. for 10-12 minutes.
  
  INSTRUCTIONS FOR SNAILS: Place dough on a lightly floured board and roll
  into a large rectangle 1/4" thick. Spread with almond butter and plumped
  currants or raisins. Roll jelly roll style. Cut into 1" slices and place
  slices 2" apart on baking sheet, cut side down. Spoon Vanilla cream in the
  center of each. Let rise until light. Bake 10-12 minutes at 375 degrees F.
  Ice and sprinkle with almonds.
