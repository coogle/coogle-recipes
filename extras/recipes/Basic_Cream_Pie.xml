      <step>  Pour milk into heavy saucepan. (well-seasoned iron skillet or pan is
  preferred). Separate eggs, add egg yolks to milk and beat in with wire
  whip. Turn burner to med. heat. In separate bowl, mix together flour, cocoa
  powder and sugar. Stir into milk/egg mixture. Cook and stir with wire whip
  until mixture begins to thicken. Add butter and continue to stir until
  mixture is thick. Stir in vanilla and pour into baked pie shell. Make your
  favorite meringue using reserved egg whites. Spread over pie filling. Brown
  in 350 degree oven till meringue is slightly browned. Watch carefully, it
  won't take too long.
  
  VARIATIONS: For coconut cream pie, add 1 to 1-1/2 c. coconut and about 1/2
  t. coconut extract to mixture when it begins to thicken. Sprinkle coconut
  on top of meringue prior to browning. You can substitute brown sugar for
  white, leave off cocoa for butterscotch pie. Leave out cocoa and add sliced
  bananas for banana cream pie. This recipe was given to my mother by Josie
  Marcum who had a restaurant in Jamestown many years ago.
