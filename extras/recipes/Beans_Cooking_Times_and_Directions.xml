  cooking temperature, length of soaking time, the size and age of the beans,
  and even the altitude at which you live.  The average yield is 2 1/4 to 2
  1/2 cups cooked legumes for every dry cup used.

  I've just discovered, thanks to an old cookbook, a faster way to cook
  beans, with very good results. The method is to drop the beans into
  boiling water sufficiently slowly that the water never stops boiling.  The
  rational, according to the cookbook, is that the sudden heat ruptures the
  bean's hull.  Hot water can then easily penetrate and cook the bean.  No
  pre-soaking is required.  The cookbook also suggests that after getting
  all the beans in the water, the heat should be turned down to as slow a
  simmer as possible, because excessive heat causes the proteins in the
  beans to get tough.  Also, no salt should be added until the beans are
  cooked, as salt hinders the water from penetrating the bean. I've tried
  this with red kidney beans and lima beans, and it worked very well.  They
  both cooked to perfectly done tenderness in 1 hour, with no pre-soaking.I
  haven't tried it with harder to cook beans, like soybeans.
