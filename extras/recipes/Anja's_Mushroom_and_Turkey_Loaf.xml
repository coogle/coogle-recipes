      <step>  here is something else I threw together last night (open the fridge, see
  what's left and use it all up...), while it came out very tasty I think it
  will probably need a bit of refinement - I would appreciate comments from
  those of you experienced with making meatloaf....  This is that I did:
  
  With my food food processor attachment I finely minced the turkey,
  mushrooms, onion and garlic.  Mixed those well with egg; salt and pepper to
  taste.  Places it in an 1 lb loaf pan and baked at 400oF for about 35 mins
  until done.
  
  While it was very tasty (and had a lovely strong mushroom flavour) I think
  the non-mushroomephiles might prefer it with the mushroom quantity halved
  or the meat doubled. Also it could do with more 'cohesion' (?), it was
  rather crumbly - I would have added a slice of bread, also minced, but we
  had run out of bread. Do you thing that would have made any difference?
  
  I served it with tomato sauce made from pureed plum tomates, which
  complemented it really well.
