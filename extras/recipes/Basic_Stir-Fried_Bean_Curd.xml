    <directions>
      <step>  1. Cut each bean curd cake in 6 to 8 pieces or in 1-inch cubes. Cut
  scallion stalk in 1-inch sections.
  
  2. Heat oil. Add salt; then scallion, and stir-fry a few times until
  translucent.  Add bean curd; stir-fry gently until heated through (2 to 3
  minutes).
  
  3. Sprinkle with soy sauce and remaining salt and stir in gently.
  
  NOTE: Since bean curd is fragile, vigorous stir-frying will demolish it.
  Therefore shake or tilt the pan from time to time to baste the bean curd
  with hot oil; or else separately turn the pieces so they can heat through
  evenly. VARIATIONS:
  
  1. For the soy sauce, substitute oyster sauce.
  
  2. Use 4 or 5 whole scallions, cut in 1-inch lengths.
  
  3. Before serving, sprinkle bean curd with a few drops of sesame oil; or
  garnish with minced raw scallion.
  
  4. With Chinese sausage: Steam 4 Chinese sausages 15 minutes; then slice
  thin. Add to heated oil in step 2 and brown lightly; then stir-fry scallion
  and bean curd.
  
  5. With mushrooms (fresh): In step 2, add after the scallion, 1/4 pound
  fresh mushrooms, sliced, and stir-fry until slightly softened. Then add the
  bean curd and continue as in steps 2 and 3.
  
  6. With mushrooms (dried): After step 2, add 10 dried black mushrooms
  (soaked), sliced, the soy sauce and 1/2 teaspoon sugar. Then gently stir in
  1/2 cup of the mushroom-soaking liquid or stock. Bring to a boil and
  simmer, covered, 5 minutes over medium heat.
  
  7. With roast pork: In step 2, add after the scallion, 1/4 cup roast pork,
  sliced or diced, and stir-fry a few times. Then add the bean curd and
  continue as in steps 2 and 3.
  
  8. With shrimp: In step 2, add after the scallion 1/4 cup raw shrimp,
  shelled, deveined and cut in 1-inch pieces; stir-fry until pinkish. Then
  add bean curd and continue as in steps 2 and 3.
