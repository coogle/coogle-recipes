      <step>  Anyone ever serve polenta with Q? Im thinking it might be good with a spicy
  brisket or ribs. Anyone have any recipes? Here is the only one I have. I
  just got it so I dont know if it is any good, but it came from the Chef Du
  Jour show.
  
  In a medium cast-iron saucepan or other heavy pot, bring all ingredients
  except cornmeal to simmer over medium heat. Very slowly, begin to sift
  cornmeal into the pan through the fingers of one hand, stirring constantly
  with wooden spoon or whisk. Gradually sift remaining meal into the pan,
  continue to stir and reduce heat to medium low. Continue to stir until the
  polenta is smooth and thick and pulls away from the sides of the pan as it
  is stirred, about 30 minutes. Discard bay leaf, pour polenta into a serving
  bowl or onto a wooden board, and allow it to rest 10 minutes. To serve from
  the bowl, dip a large spoon into water and scoop polenta onto individual
  dishes, dipping the spoon into the water between scoops. To serve from the
  board, cut polenta into segments with a thin, taut string or knife and
  transfer to plates with a spatula or cake knife.
