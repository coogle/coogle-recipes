  Bring water to a boil in a large heavy pot. Add salt and reduce heat until
  water is simmering. Take cornmeal by the handful and add to water very
  slowly, controlling the flow to a thin stream through your fingers. To
  avoid lumps, stir quickly with a long handled wooden spoon while adding
  cornmeal. If necessary, stop adding cornmeal from time to time and beat
  mixture vigorously. Cook, stirring constantly, 20 to 30 minutes. Polenta
  will become very thick while cooking. It is done when it comes away cleanly
  from the sides of the pot. Pour polenta into a large wooden board or a
  large platter. Wet your hands and smooth out polenta evenly, about 2 inches
  thick. Let cool 5 to 10 minutes or until polenta solidifies. Cut cooled
  polenta into slices 1 inch wide and 6 inches long. Place slices in
  individual dishes. Serve hot, covered with your favorite sauce. Makes 6 to
        8    servings.
  
  Variation: Fried Polenta (Polenta Fritta): Prepare polenta and let cool
  completely. Cut cooled polenta into slices 2 inches wide and 6 inches long.
  Pour oil about 1 inch deep in a large skillet. Heat oil until a 1-inch cube
  of bread turns golden almost immediately. Fry polenta slices on both sides
  until light golden. Drain on paper towels. Serve hot. It is importent to
  insure the oil is hot enough, otherwise the polenta will absorb oil and
  your polenta will be greasy and unpalatable.
