  Here is the recipe for my chili that appears in BeeR the magazine.
  
  I grew up all over the place and was introduced to hot food at a young age.
  My wanderings took me to Texas for a while. It was there I learned that
  true chili is not some form of bastardized spaghetti sauce or that
  abomination eaten with zeal in Cincinati.
  
  Chili is basic food. It is, in fact, one of the four food groups along with
  coffee, bagels, and beer. Meat, onions, chiles. What could be simpler,
  right? But then why is the perfect chili recipe so ellusive? Well, I'll
  tell ya. It's because people get too far away from the basics and mix in
  influences from cultures that have no business making chili. Cultures like
  New York and that large flat area between Pittsburgh and Denver. There are
  two styles of chili; Texas and New Mexico. Bad Attitude is from Texas.
  
  One aside. Watch the spelling. C-H-I-L-I is make with chile. C-H-I-L-E is
  (1) God's greatest gift to humans, (2) a country named after our favorite
  fruit, and (3) how mothers pronounce, " Chile! Gitchyer butt over here!"
  
  This recipe comes from years of Friday afternoons dedicated to
  cards-beer-blow-off-steam sessions while at dental school in south Texas.
  We used venison and pork, but any vertabrate is fine. (Armadillo is not
  allowed in Texas as it is the Official State Critter and has been granted
  asylum from the chili pot.) Vegetarian chili? Is that like jumbo shrimp?
  Military intelligence? Legal ethics? Painless dentist?
  
  Chili is not supposed to be blow you head off hot. I have two criteria for
  proper heat. (1) I should sweat under my eyes. (2) I should be able to eat
  the whole bowl without stopping to cool off. There is supposed to be a lot
  of chile flavor and no tomato flavor. This can only be had through high
  quality chile powder and fresh roasted peppers.
  
  To bean or not to bean? That is the question for people that like to
  discuss things like the meaning of life. Or how many angels can do the
  Cotton Eyed Joe on the head of a pin. Or is there a limit to Deion $anders'
  ego. If you are going to bean, pintos and black are good. Kidney beans are
  a sin.
  
  In time, this recipe has taken on life of its own. It has been know to
  change major weather patterns, cement faltering relationships, depose minor
  dictatorships, and affect the outcome of the Superbowl. Remember to use its
  power for good.
  
  Sautee 1/4 of the garlic and onions until translucent. Add 1/4 of the meat,
  chile powder and brown. Salt the meat while cooking. Put into your chili
  pot. Cast iron is best. Repeat until all the meat is done. Put the rest of
  the ingredients in you chili pot and simmer for for a hour.
  
  As in any recipe, the amount of ingredients is variable. Add more of
  anything you want, especially chiles.
  
  You now have the power. Use it wisely. The eyes of Texas are upon you!
