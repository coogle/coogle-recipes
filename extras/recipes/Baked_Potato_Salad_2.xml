      <step>  *Guess my potatoes were smaller than theirs - about 14 for me. Coat
  potatoes with vegetable cooking spray; pierce several times with a fork.
  Bake at 400 degrees for 45 minutes or until tender. Cool and cut into
  1-inch cubes. Combine 1-1/2 cups cheese, dressing, and next 3 ingredients
  in a large bowl; add potato, tossing gently. Sprinkle with bacon and
  remaining 1/2 cup of cheese.
  
  Lou's notes: I did not have the Sargento Light cheese, so I used regular
  mild Cheddar cheese. Also, I did not have turkey bacon so I used regular.
  
  I thought the ratio of mix to potatoes was a bit off . Next time, I will
  use more potatoes.
  
  I let the potatoes cool a bit before I added them so as not to melt the
  cheese. Served the salad at room temperature. The next day, I had it cold,
  and it was good that way, too. This is a very tasty dish. Clearly, there
  has been an effort to reduce the fat, but no caloric nor fat information
  was given.
