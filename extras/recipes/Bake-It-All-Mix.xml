      <step>  This Mix collection is from a company called Jewel. I don't think that
  their product is available any longer, so I have substituted just the word
  shortening for the Jewel shortening. I have had excellant results using
  either Crisco or (lately) Mazola shortening in these recipes.
  Unfortunately, I think the Jewel shortening has gone to the shortening
  heaven with Spry and several others whose name eludes me now. Thank
  goodness the recipes have survived! *4 Tablespoons Combine sifted flour,
  salt and baking powder. Stir well. Sift into a large bowl or pan. Add
  shortening. Use a pastry blender to distribute shortening throughout dry
  ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal and small peas. The
  Bake-It-All Mix is now ready to use or store in a canister on your cupboard
  shelf. A cool area is desirable. Yield: About 12 cups
