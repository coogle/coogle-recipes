      <step>   A couple of months back there was a discussion on how to make Aebleskiver.
  As a lover of Aebleskiver it really hurt me to see how "distorted" some of
  these reci pes were. So when I bought the book "Mad", by Ingeborg Suhr from
  1942 I decided to enlighten you poor netters.  The following three recipes
  are from the country where Aebleskiver originated and are the "real thing".
  Although Ingeborg Suhr does not say anything about it I would suggest
  serving with either sifted confectioners sugar, blackberry jam or both. At
  Christmas I would suggest serving with glogg.
  
   Sift flour with sugar and salt. Mix yeast with lukewarm cream (or milk).
  Add eggs (one at a time).  Combine all of the previous. Leave for
  approximately 2 hours to raise.  Bake in Aebleskiver pan to golden brown at
  low heat.
  
   NOTES : 10 grams of baking powder could be added, then the cream should
  not be heated and the Aebleskiver should be baked at once. A little apple
  sauce or pieces of apple could be added while baking.
