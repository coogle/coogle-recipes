      <step>  Mix sugars.  Boil milk with half of sugars for two minutes. Let it cool
  down. (For the milk it is easiest to use a pot which can later be used with
  a mixer.)
  
  Mix well (mixer at high speed) the yolks with the other half of the sugars.
  Using mixer add to milk. Then (still using mixer) add alcohol slowly. (The
  result is quite fluid, sweet and strong.)  Bottle and let rest for two
  weeks to let the mixture thicken.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Egg-cognac:  a potent sweet alcoholic beverage -- Advokaat is the Dutch
  word for egg cognac.  It is highly recommended for A. I. (Alcohol Imbibing)
  meetings. This recipe is my modification of a recipe I obtained in Poland.
  It makes a potent, superb advokaat (or egg-cognac). The milk and eggs are
  healthy, the sugar and alcohol are not. Yield: Serves 4-8.
  
  *  This advokaat can be drunk or, better yet, eaten with a spoon; it is
  quite thick.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 2 weeks aging.
  : Precision:  Measure the ingredients.
