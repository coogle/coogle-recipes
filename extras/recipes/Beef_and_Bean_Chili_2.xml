      <step>  ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''' '' Preheat oven to
      400    deg F.
   In a mixing bowl, sift together the flours, baking powder, and salt. In
  another bowl, combine 1/3 cup of the sugar with the melted butter until it
  dissolves. Stir in the milk, then combine the wet with the dry ingredients
  and work together to form a soft dough. Turn the dough out onto a
  well-floured board and knead for a minute or so. Divide the dough into 2
  equal parts, form into smooth balls, and roll out to to fit the bottom of a
  pie pan. Place the rounds of dough in 2 lightly oiled pie pans. Bake for
  12-15 minutes, or until dough is golden brown.
   In the meantime, combine the crushed strawberries with the remaining 3 T
  sugar in a small bowl. Cover until ready to use.
   Allow the baked dough to cool until it is just warm to the touch. Place 1
  round on a serving plate, spread it with the berries, and top with the
  other round of dough. Cut into wedges to serve; this is best served fresh
  and warm. Top each serving with a bit of cold, stiffly beaten heavy cream
  if you'd like.
   Sprinkle sliced strawberries with sugar; set aside.
   Beat milk with lemon juice until thick. Fold in strawberries and whipped
  cream. Divide among crepes; fold. Garnish with additional whipped cream and
  a strawberry centered on the cream. Yields 6 servings.
   Soak gelatin in milk, in custard cup. Set cup in boiling water; stir until
  gelatin is completely dissolved.
   Combine yogurt, sugar, and salt. Stir in gelatin mixture. Stir in berries
  and lemon juice. Chill until slightly thickened; beat until foamy. Fold in
  whipped cream. Pour mixture in metal ice-cube tray. Cover with foil;
  freeze.
   NOTE: I have also made this with approx 1/2 of 1 pint of fresh
  strawberries, well crushed. I then froze it in a Donvier ice cream maker.
  Delicious! * hulled, cleaned, and halved
  
   Combine strawberries and sugar. Cover; let stand 15 minutes.
   Prepare topping. Beat together yolks, 1/3 cup sugar, vanilla, nutmeg, and
  brandy until smooth. Fold in yopurt.
   Spoon strawberries into 4 sherbert dishes. Cover with topping; garnish
  with almonds and chocolate. Yield 4 servings.
