    <directions>
      <step>  In a large bowl, soften the yeast in the lukewarm water.  Mix the salt, 2
  tablespoons of the shortening, and the cold water together and add to the
  yeast mixture.
  
  Sift in the flour gradually, beating well after each addition for a smooth
  consistency.  You will probably have to knead in the final cup of flour.
  
  Shape the dough into a ball, brish lightly with the remaining shortening,
  and cover with a dry cloth.  Set the bowl in a warm place until doubled in
  bulk, anout 1 hour.
  
  Punch the dough down and, on a floured board, knead about 5 minutes. Shape
  into 2 round loaves on a well greased baking sheet.  Cover with a dry cloth
  and set to rise another 45 minutes.
  
  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.  Bake the loaves on a cookie sheet 50
  minutes, until they are light brown and sound hollow when tapped. *****
  
  This is an adaptation of the traditional recipe that is still being used by
  almost every Native American family.
