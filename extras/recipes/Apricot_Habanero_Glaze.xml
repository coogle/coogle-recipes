  In a good-sized skillet heat about a half-cup water over medium heat until
  it begins steaming.  Carefully cut small slices from the dried habanero and
  chop those finely to accumulate about 1/2 tsp or so of flakes, adjusting to
  your taste and heat tolerance.  (You might want to wear rubber gloves when
  touching the pepper; at least be careful and don't touch your eyes until
  your hands have been thoroughly washed.) Add the pepper flakes with the
  salt and butter to the water and allow the flakes to soften and the butter
  to melt. Add the brown sugar (stir to dissolve) and raisins. When the water
  is simmering, add the apricot preserves. Cut up any large pieces of apricot
  in the pan, and make sure all the gelatinous matter is dissolved. Add the
  vinegar a little at a time, being careful not to make the mixture at all
  sour; the vinegar should just brighten up the taste.
  
  Allow the glaze to simmer.  As it thickens, water can be added a bit at a
  time to keep the glaze from scorching; it should be allowed to darken a
  bit.
  
  Coat grilled chops or meat slices with the glaze by simmering the meats
  with the glaze for a couple minutes on each side. Spread a teaspoon or so
  on each serving plate and arrange meats on top. Little mint sprigs and
  curls of orange peel could be used to give a truly foofy appearance, if you
  like that kinda thing.
