      <step>  Recipe by: The Ultimate Pasta Machine Cookbook Following the instructions
  given in your owner's manual, prepare and set up the pasta machine with an
  extruder die to make the desired shape of pasta.
  
  All ingredients must be at room temperature.  Place the liquid ingredients
  in a glass measuring cup.  If less than 3/4 cup, add some water to make up
  the balance.
  
  Add the dry ingredients to the pasta machine mixing bowl. Switch the pasta
  machine on.  Slowly pour the liquid ingredients through the feed tube. Mix
  for approximately 3 minutes, or until the dough appears to be coming
  together in soft pea-sized crumbs.
  
  Following the instructions given in your owners' manual, begin to extrude
  the dough.  Cut off the first 2 to 3 inches extruded and discard. As the
  pasta begins to come out, gently move it away from the machine. Cut with a
  sharp knife or scissors at desired lengths. Place extruded pasta on a wire
  rack or on a clean kitchen cloth. Let sit for at least 30 minutes before
  cooking, or store for later use.
