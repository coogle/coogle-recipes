    <directions>
      <step>  1 c sugar 1/2 c water 1/4 c light corn syrup 1/2 tsp salt 2 Tbsp vinegar 1
  tsp vanilla or other flavoring such as orange or lemon, or use 1/2 tsp
  peppermint, or 1 oz bitter chocolate, grated.
  
  Cook sugar, water, corn syrup, salt and vinegar until a few drops of the
  mixture will make a hard ball in cold water, 260 degrees on a candy
  thermometer.  Pour onto a greased dish or platter, sprinkle flavoring over
  top and turn the outer edges of the candy in toward the center until cool
  and firm enough to handle.
  
  Best results are obtained in pulling if the tips of the thumbs and fingers
  are dipped in cornstarch or fat. Use only the fingertips to pull taffy.
  When mixture can be handled, take up and pull out with both hands. Fold
  over and pull out again.
  
  As the mixture becomes cooler and the longer it is pulled, it will become
  stiffer and can be pulled out in a longer strand. Pull until it is
  difficult to pull out and the mixture seems quite firm.
  
  Pull into long thin strips and cut immediately with greased scissors and
  roll each piece in powdered sugar or wrap in wax paper. Store cooled taffy
  in an air tight container in a cool dry place.
  
  If the taffy sugars, it can be recooked by putting it in a pan with 2 Tbsp
  corn syrup and 1/4 c water.  Stir until dissolved and then recook according
  to original directions.
  
  Finely chopped nuts or fruit, as well as other flavorings, are added as the
  taffy is being pulled.
