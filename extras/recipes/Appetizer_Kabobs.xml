  Wrap 1 inch cubes of sharp process American cheese in partially cooked
  slices of bacon.  Wash fresh mushrooms, don't soak or peel, or use canned
  mushroom crowns.  Alternate bacon cheese cubes and mushrooms on skewers
  along with stuffed green olives and cocktail weiners. Leave a little space
  between tidbits on the skewer.  Rotate over coals till bacon and mushrooms
  are done and cheese is melty.  Brush mushrooms with melted butter or
  margarine, or salad oil while cooking. Tastes good with catsup, mustard or
  soy sauce added.
