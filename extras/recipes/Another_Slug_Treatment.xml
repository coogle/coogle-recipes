  Reader Mary Jo Forbus of Arlington, WA wrote: "A few squirts are all it
  takes; they die right before your eyes, a very gratifying sight! The
  mixture is harmless to soil and plants. I keep my spray bottle nearby when
  gardening and check the garden twice a day, once early in the morning and
  again late in the evening."
