  In thanks for everyone's help with my spider infestation problem, I'm
  paying off with a recipe from the bachelor's recipe file (mine). If you
  aren't single, don't even attempt this at home.
  
  Pat fish dry with a paper towel, and then flour both sides.  Heat oil in a
  skillet and add the snapper fillet.  Lightly coat the top side with the hot
  sauce.  Cook around 10-15 minutes per side at medium-low heat.  Eat.
