      <step>  You can eat the following foods whenever you feel hungry until you are full
  (but not until you are stuffed):
  
  o Beans and legumes (lentils, kidney beans, peas, black beans, red Mexican
  beans, split peas, soybeans, black-eyed peas, garbanzos, navy beans, and so
  on)
  
  o Fruits (apples, apricots, bananas, strawberries, cherries, blueberries,
  oranges, peaches, raspberries, cantaloupes, watermelons, pears, honeydew
  melons, pineapples, tomatoes, etc.)
  
  o Grains (corn, rice, oats, wheat, millet, barley, buckwheat, etc.)
  
  o Vegetables (potatoes, zucchini, broccoli, carrots, lettuce, mushrooms,
  eggplant, celery, asparagus, onions, sweet potatoes, spinach, etc.)
  
  You can eat the following foods in moderation:
  
  o Nonfat dairy products, including skim milk, nonfat yogurt, nonfat
  cheeses, nonfat sour cream, and egg whites. [Equivalent of one cup of skim
  milk per day from all sources.]
  
  o Nonfat or very low-fat commercially available products, including Life
  Choice frozen dinners, whole-grain breakfast cereals, Health Valley chili
  (and many other Health Valley products), Kraft Free non-fat mayonnaise and
  salad dressings, Guiltless Gourmet tortilla chips, Quaker Oats oatmeal,
  Nabisco Fat-free crackers, Fleischmann's Egg Beaters, Pritikin soups, Light
  n' Lively Free nonfat sour cream, Haagen-Dazs frozen yogurt bars,
  Entenmann's fat-free desserts (watch out for sugar, though), and many
  others.  Many more fat-free products are on the way.
  
  Here are the foods to avoid as much as possible:
  
  o Meats (all kinds, including chicken and fish)
  
  o Oils (all kinds) and oil-containing products, including margarines and
  most salad dressings

  o High-fat or "low-fat" dairy, including whole milk, yogurt, butter,
  cheese, egg yolks, cream, and so on
  
  o Sugar and simple sugar derivatives (honey, molasses, corn syrup, high
  fructose syrup, and the like)
  
  o Alcohol
  
  o Any commercially available product with more than two grams of fat per
  serving
