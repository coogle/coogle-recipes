      <step>  I take fish fillets (any kind) and put them in an oven proof dish. I cover
  with Green Giant vegetable mixtures (any kind that you prefer or their
  pasta accents) and then add 1/2 can of tomatoes. I bake in an oven warmed
  to 350 for about 20 minutes.  Sprinkle parmesan cheese on top and serve
  with rice, baked potato, pasta or just a salad. It's delicious and doesn't
  cost any optional calories.
  
  2 oz. cooked fish = 1 protein selection.
  
  This is my own concoction for fish but I cooked it for my sister-in-law and
  she loved it.  I'm not much of a fish eater but with 2 for 1 on the
  protein, it's becoming more popular in my diet plans. Lori in MD.
