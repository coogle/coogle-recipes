      <step>  Mix all dry ingredients together in large bowl (if you have a large mixer
  it is ideal to use for blending this mix but it can also be done quite
  adequately using a pastry blender to cut in shortening). Add shortening
  about a half cup at a time mixing well after each addition. Mixture will be
  mealy when mixed adequately. Put in air-tight container and store either in
  refrigerator or at room temperature. Use within about 3 months.
  
  YIELD: about 12 cups of mix
  
  For Biscuits: Mix 2 cups of Baking Mix with 1/2 cup water. Bake at 450F for
  8-10 minutes.
  
  For Muffins: Mix 2 cups of Baking Mix with 2 Tbsp sugar, 1 beaten egg and
  2/3 cup milk. Bake at 400F for 15 minutes.
  
  For Pancakes: Mix 2 cups of baking mix with 1 beaten egg and 1 1/3 cup
  milk.
  
  For Waffles: Mix 2 cups of Baking Mix with 1 beaten egg, 2 Tbsp oil, and 1
      1/3    cup milk.
  
  NOTES : You can use this mix to make biscuits, dumplings, muffins, coffee
  cake, pancakes and waffles. It can also be used as an ingredient in
  casseroles and desserts.
