    <directions>
      <step>  1. Put on the water for the noodles. Bring to a boil. Dissolve the beef
  bouillon in the wine.
  
  2. Prepare the meat by removing any silverskin, fat or whatever. Slice the
  meat across the grain into 2- 3" strips. Then, in a medium skillet, sauté
  the meat using 2 tablespoons of butter till the meat is just browned but
  still rare. (DO NOT OVERCOOK, it will be tough!) Remove from skillet,
  reserving all juices.
  
  3. With two tablespoons of butter, sauté the onions, garlic and mushrooms
  until the onion is just tender/crisp. Add the reserved juices, flour, salt
  and pepper. Stir until smooth. Blend the wine/bouillon mixture into the
  onion, garlic and mushrooms. Add the catsup and sautéed meat. Bring to boil
  over medium/high heat while stirring. Reduce heat and simmer uncovered for
  10 to 15 minutes to thicken sauce and tenderize meat.
  
  4. Cook the noodles per directions and drain. (approx.. 10 minutes, do not
  rinse) Add 2 Tablespoons butter, stir until coated. Or omit the butter and
  stir the stroganoff mixture directly into the noodles.
  
  5. Fold the sour cream into the sauce mixture and heat through. Do not
  allow to boil.
  
  6. Serve over buttered noodles with crusty bread and one or two of the
  following: steamed broccoli, grilled zucchini, pickled beets, chilled
  pears.
  
  Suggested Wine: Whichever was used for sauce
  
  Serving Ideas : Steamed broccoli, grilled zucchini, pickled beets, pears
  
  NOTES : You may use your own preferences whether to use butter or oil. You
  may use 1 to 1-1/2 pounds of any whole or ground meat or make it vegetarian
  with no meat. The meat flavor strength goes up as follows, Elk, beef, bear,
  venison. Use a wine that corresponds in flavor strength to the type of
  meat. The wine chosen will also affect the sweetness of the dish.  I.E.
  Venison and Burgundy, Elk and Madeira. You may need to increase the cooking
  time a bit to tenderize the meat or to thicken the sauce prior to adding
  the sour cream.  See "Hamburger Stroganoff" for a non-wine, creamy sauce.
