    <directions>
      <step>  1. Butter a six to 8 cup mold, casserole or baking dish.
  
  2. Melt two tablespoons of the butter in a large heavy skillet over
  medium-high heat. When the foam subsides. add the apples, increase to high
  and saute the apples, turning them frequently for about 5 minutes until
  they begin to color. Do not allow them to become soft or lose their shape.
  
  3.Add three tablespoons of sugar and saute another minute or two until the
  sugar begins to carmelize. Stir in the crystalized ginger, remove from heat
  and transfer the apples and ginger to a bowl.
  
  4. Reduce heat to low, add the remaining four tablespoons of butter to the
  skillet. When the butter has melted, scrape the pan to loosen any bits of
  carmelized sugar clinging to it. Add the bread cubes and toss them in the
  butter until they are evenly coated.
  
  5. Scatter half the apples and ginger into the baking dish.Cover with half
  the bread cubes. Repeat the layers.
  
  6. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
  
  7. Lightly beat the eggs and one-half cup of sugar. Scald the milk. Slowly
  pour the scalded milk in a thin stream into the egg mixture, stirring
  constantly. Stir in the vanilla and ground ginger. Pour over the apples and
  bread in the baking dish.
  
  8. Set the dish in a pan and add boiling water to come halfway up the sides
  of the baking dish. Place in the middle of the oven and bake 45 minutes,
  until the top is crusty and golden. Serve while still warm.
