    <directions>
      <step>  Iceberg lettuce leaves, 2 or 3 for each person Bone and finely chop the
  pork. Do not grind this as you want very small pieces to "climb" on the
  branches of the noodles. Marinate the pork in the soy, wine and ginger for
  about 15 minutes. Slice the green onions. Finely chop the cabbage and
  mushrooms, reserving the soaking water from the mushrooms. Heat the oil in
  a wok until it is just beginning to smoke. Use good ventilation in your
  kitchen for this one! Open the noodle package and undo them a bit. Drop
  into the hot fat in small batches. They will immediately puff up into
  wonderful white crunchy noodles. Turn quickly to be sure that all of them
  are cooked. Remove from the pan and drain on paper towels. Be very careful
  with this. You could burn yourself. Set the noodles aside. Heat another wok
  or frying pan and add 1 Tablespoon of the peanut oil. Add the chopped
  garlic and toss for a moment. Add the meat and marinade and stir fry,
  mixing it about, until the meat is tender but not dry, about 3 minutes on
  high heat. Remove the meat mixture and add the vegetables to the wok. Stir
  fry over high heat for 3 more minutes. Return the meat to the pan and add
  the hot bean sauce, sugar and black pepper. Stir fry for 1 minute and then
  add the cornstarch dissolved in the water. Stir until the sauce thickens.
  If you have too little sauce, add a bit of the water in which you have
  soaked the mushrooms. Add the sesame oil and stir. Place the fried noodles
  on a large platter and pour the meat and vegetable mixture over the
  noodles. Do this carefully so that the little pieces of pork and mushrooms
  will cling to the "branches". Toss at the table in front of your guests.
  Each person then takes a bit of noodle and meat sauce and places it in the
  center of a lettuce leaf. Roll it up like a burrito and enjoy. Serves 6-8
