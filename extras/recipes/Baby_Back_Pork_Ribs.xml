  These are the worlds best ribs. I know. I was born in Memphis and have
  lived in Texas and South Carolina. I have tried every way there is to
  prepare ribs on the grill. It is dangerous muck about with this recipe. I
  once even tried to use spare ribs and my wife almost cried. These are
  perfect.  There is a BBQ joint in heaven. It has one thing on the menu.
  This is it.
  
  One rack of  baby back pork ribs per moderately hungry person
  
  marinate in cider vinegar for a few minutes
  
  liberal amounts of garlic salt
  
  liberal amounts of canned black pepper
  
  The smoker should be at 200-225F. Use a pan of water in the smoker.
  Mesquite, hickory, or oak chunks on natural charcoal. Briquettes are filled
  with petroleum and coal and will give you laboratory rats in your bladder.
  No amount of homebrew will flush them out either. I won't even discuss the
  evils of propane. Should take 2 1/2 hours. For an good afforadble smoker,
  look at the Brinkmann's Porfessiona'
  
  That's it? Yep. Don't change a thing. Don't use fresh ground pepper or
  cloves of garlic. If you need sauce( you won't ), it goes on the side.  And
  yes, chipotles en adobo make for a great BBQ sauce.
