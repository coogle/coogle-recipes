  Instead of applesauce with latkes, this can be served as a chunky topping
  or pureed into a flavorful fresh applesauce. When the apples are left in
  pieces, the compote can be served as a dessert on its own; its especially
  good served hot with ice cream, sour cream, or yogurt.
  
  Peel &amp; halve the apples. Core &amp; cut into thin wedges or slices.
  
  Melt butter in large skillet over medium heat. Add apples &amp; saute, turning
  pieces over from time to time, for about 2 minutes or until they are coated
  with butter. Add lemon juice and cinnamon, cover &amp; cook over low heat for 5
  minutes, or until liquid begins to come out of the apples. Uncover &amp;
  continue cooking over low heat, gently stirring occasionally, for 15-20
  minutes or until apples are tender and begin to fall apart.
  
  Add 2 tbsp sugar &amp; saute over medium-high heat, turning apples over, about
  2 minutes or just until sugar dissolves. Remove from heat. Taste &amp; add more
  sugar if necessary; heat, tossing apples gently, until sugar dissolves.
  Serve warm or at room temperature to accompany latkes.
  
  Can be kept covered in refrigerator for 2 days.
