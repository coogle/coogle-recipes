      <step>  Equipment: One 9 by 5 inch loaf pan, oiled or buttered
  
  Mix one batch of the White Pan Loaf dough according to instructions given
  in recipe.
  
  Place the just mixed dough in a clean bowl lightly dusted with flour. Cover
  the bowl with a towel and allow the dough to rise at room temperature (75
  degrees to 77 degrees F) for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, until it doubles in volume.
  (An indentation made by poking your finger deep into the dough should not
  spring back.)
  
  While the dough is rising, place the raisins in a bowl or a plastic
  container and fill with warm water to come just below the top of the
  raisins. (If you use too much water, you will rinse away the natural
  sweetness of the raisins.)
  
  Place the dough on a very lightly floured surface. Gently deflate the dough
  and pat it into a rectangle that is about 3/4 of an inch thick, and about 6
  inches by 12 inches in size. The short sides should be the top and bottom
  edges.
  
  Mix the cinnamon and sugar together, and sprinkle it evenly over the dough.
  
  Drain the raisins and toss them with the remaining 2 tablespoons flour.
  Spread the raisins evenly over the dough and gently press them into it.
  
  Starting at a short side, roll the dough into a log. Roll the dough
  tightly, keeping the skin of the dough slightly taut, and tucking in any
  raisins that fall out, but don't stretch the dough so tight that the skin
  tears. Seal the seam of the log gently but tightly using the heel of your
  hand against the surface of the table, or pinch it shut with your fingers.
  
  Place the loaf in an oiled or buttered 9 by 5 inch loaf pan, and cover with
  oiled plastic wrap. Let the dough rise at room temperature for 1 1/2 to 2
  1/2 hours, or until the loaf has risen almost 1 inch above the sides of the
  pans.
  
  Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.
  
  Place the loaf pan on the center oven rack. Using a plant sprayer, mist the
  loaf 8 to 10 times, then quickly shut the oven door. Spray the bread again
  after 2 minutes.
  
  Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F and
  bake for 20 to 30 minutes longer, until the crust is deep brown and the
  loaf sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. The crust may color quickly
  because of the cinnamon and raisins in the dough; watch carefully and cover
  the top of the loaf loosely with foil if it is browning too fast. Let cool
  in the pan for 5 minutes, then remove the bread from the pan and place the
  loaf on a rack to cool. Let cool completely before slicing, or the bread
  will fall apart. This bread keeps well for at least 2 days.
