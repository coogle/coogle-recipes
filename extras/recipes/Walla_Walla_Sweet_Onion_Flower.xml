  Whole, crispy fried Walla Walla Sweet Onions cut to resemble flowers are a
  popular treat at fairs and festivals throughout Washington State. The
  "petals" of the onion are simply torn off and dipped in zesty barbecue
  sauce. Try this simple, reduced-fat version which can easily be made in the
  oven. The lovely presentation and combination of flavors make a memorable
  plate, especially when paired with good company and a tall, cool lemonade.
  
  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Lightly grease a large baking or roasting
  pan. Peel the Walla Walla Sweet Onions, cut the bottom level, but leave the
  core intact. To make the flower design, begin as if you are going to cut
  the onion in half, from top to bottom, but stop cutting 1/2 inch from the
  core. Cut the onion this way 5 times to form ten sections or "petals."
  Carefully loosen the petals slightly by rapping the onion lightly on the
  work surface, and loosening them with your fingers. Remember that the
  flower will bloom more as it cooks.
  
  Place the flour, salt, pepper, oregano, paprika and mustard in a small
  paper bag. Spray the onions with cooking spray to lightly coat each petal.
  Put one of the onions in the bag and gently shake to coat. Remove the onion
  and pat off the excess flour mixture. Place in a prepared pan and repeat
  with the other onion. Spray the coated onions lightly again with cooking
  spray to aid in browning.
  
  Bake the onions in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, until tender.
  Serve the onion flowers hot, with your favorite barbecue sauce as a dip.
  
  Serves: 4
