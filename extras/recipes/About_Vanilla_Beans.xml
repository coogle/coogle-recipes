      <step>  Information from the 1996 Old Farmer's Almanac, "What You Can Eat To
  Achieve True Peace of Mind", by Ken Haedrich
  
  The vanilla orchid is a member of the plant family known as Orchidaceae and
  is the only orchid that produces edible fruit.  The beans grow on a thick
  vine that flourishes in warm, moist climates within 25 degrees of the
  equator.  The vanilla plant begins to bear fruit when it is three or four
  years old.  Eight to nine months after pollination, the beans are golden
  yellow and ready for harvest and curing.
  
  It takes about five to six pounds of green, freshly picked vanilla beans to
  make one pound of properly cured beans.  There are basically two ways to
  cure the beans:  in the sun or over a fire.  Using the solar method, beans
  are spread in the hot sun by day and wrapped in blankets and placed in
  wooden boxes by night.  The sweating process is repeated over and over for
  six months, until the beans have lost up to 80 percent of their moisture
  content.  This method produces superior results and is used in Madascar,
  Mexico, the former Bourbon Islands, Tonga, and Tahiti.
  
  The wood-fire curing method, used in Indonesia and Bali, takes only two or
  three weeks, but produces a dry, brittle bean with a smoky flavor,
  generally considered inferior.
  
  When you buy a vanilla bean at your market, the black, oily, smooth pod
  you're buying is a cured bean.  When you purchase a bottle of pure vanilla
  extract, you're buying beans whose flavor components have been dissolved in
  a solution of water and alcohol.  By law, pure vanilla extract must contain
  at least 35 percent alcohol by volume. Anything less is labeled a flavor.
  Pure vanilla extracts come in a variety of folds, or strengths. The Food
  and Drug Administration has established that a fold of vanilla is the
  extractive matter of 13.35 ounces of vanilla beans to a gallon of liquid.
  Strong, pure extracts, such as four-fold, are primarily used in mass food
  production.
  
  What about imitation vanilla? ~----------------------------
  
  Not only is pure vanilla expensive, but demand also far exceeds the world's
  supply of the real thing.  Stepping in to fill the void is the chemist, who
  has come up with a variety of imitations made from synthetic vanillin, the
  organic component that gives vanilla its distinctive flavor and fragrance.
  Most synthetic vanillin is a byproduct of the paper industry, made by
  cooking and treating wood-pulp effluent. But since vanillin is only one of
  more than 150 flavor and fragrance compounds found in pure vanilla, the
  chemist has yet to match the subtlety with which Mother Nature has endowed
  the real thing.
  
  How to tell a good bean when you see one.
  ~----------------------------------------
  
  Quality is key.  To truly experience all the flavor and fragrance vanilla
  has to offer, you have to seek out quality beans and extracts. Generally
  speaking, look for beans that are supple and aromatic. Tahitian beans are
  moister and relatively short and plump, with thin skins and a floral aroma.
  Bourbon beans (so called because they originate in Madagascar, Reunion, and
  the Comoros, formerly known as the Bourbon Islands) are slightly dryer,
  contain more natural vanillin, and have thick skins (the flavor has nothing
  to do with bourbon whiskey.) Stay away from dry, brittle, or smoky-smelling
  beans.  Depending upon quality and variety, single vanilla beans retail
  from about $1.50 to $10 apiece.  Vanilla beans should be kept at room
  temperature in an airtight container.  Don't refrigerate them or they may
  develop mold.  Vanilla beans last up to two years.
  
  Especially if you cook with it often, it is more economical to buy pure
  vanilla extract by the pint, or even the quart, and share it with a friend.
  The best pure extracts contain no caramel and artificial color and little
  or no sugar.  Store extract at room temperature, tightly closed. It will
  keep up to five years.
