      <step>  Recipe by: Randy Pollak Preparation Time: 4:00 In a large bowl, combine
  starter, water, yeast, sugar, salt, and 1 cup of flour. Set aside in warm
  place for about 15 minutes to proof. Add remaining flour and knead dough
  until smooth and elastic. Cover with bowl and allow to double (about 1 1/2
  hours). Punch down dough and divide in half. Shape dough into two baguettes
  by first rolling dough into a large rectangle, then roll rectangle into
  loaf (tuck ends underneath loaf), place on baking sheet and allow to double
  again. With a very sharp knife, make a slit down each loaf. Bake in a
  pre-heated 375-degree oven for 30 minutes, Test for doneness by tapping on
  loaf; it should sound hollow. For a crispy crust, periodically spray water,
  with a hair sprayer, into the oven while loaves are baking. DARK RYE:
  Substitute 3 cups of rye flour for 3 cups of the all purpose flour. Add 2
  tablespoons of caraway seeds to the batter, along with 1 cup of dark
  molasses, and 2 tablespoons of powdered cocoa. Substitute brown sugar for
  the plain sugar. Reduce water by 1/4 cup. RAISIN-CINNAMON: Add 2 slightly
  beaten eggs to the batter, after proofing. Roll each half of dough into a
  large rectangle. Sprinkle each rectangle with a mixture of, 1/4 cup sugar
  and 1 tablespoon of ground cinnamon. Sprinkle each half with 1/2 cup of
  raisins. Carefully roll each rectangle as you would to shape a baguette.
  tuck the ends underneath the loaf. Allow to rise until doubled, do not
  split tops of loaves. After baking brush loaves with melted butter.
  GARLIC-CHEESE: Add 1 cup of grated parmesan cheese to batter. Mince 6
  cloves of garlic, add to batter. After splitting tops of loaves, carefully
  pour 1 tablespoon of garlic butter on the top of each loaf. For a cheesier
  loaf, before rolling rectangle into baguette, sprinkle with 1/2 cup of
  grated cheddar cheese.
