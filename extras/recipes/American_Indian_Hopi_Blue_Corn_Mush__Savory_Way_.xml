    <directions>
      <step>  Bring water to a boil in a saucepan, add salt to taste, and whisk in the
  cornmeal. Lower the heat and stir the cornmeal for 10 minutes or until it
  tastes done. The coarser the meal, the longer it will take. Pour the cooked
  cereal onto a cookie sheet or into a bread pan and set it aside to cool for
  an hour or so or until firm. Once it has cooled, slice it into pieces for
  frying. Fry the slices in butter or oil in a nonstick pan until lightly
  crisped on both sides. If this is to be eaten as a savory, sprinkle a
  little red chili or paprika on top just before serving.
  
  This is cooked like cornmeal mush, molded in a bread pan, and then sliced
  and fried. It is delicious with a clear corn flavor and odd purple-blue
  color. It's good with eggs and bacon, or with butter.
