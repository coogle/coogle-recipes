      <step>  Mix all of the ingredients together and blend until there are no lumps.
  Preheat the oil in your deep fat fryer to the proper temperature for the
  
  food you are cooking. Dry the fish or the vegetables with a paper towel and
  dip into the batter. Place in the hot oil one piece at a time. Try to keep
  the pieces from colliding until the batter has had a chance to set (which
  it does almost instantly). Cook until the batter has turned a golden brown,
  remove to a paper towel to drain and serve at once.
  
  YIELD: enough for about 2 pounds of fish or vegetables
  
  NOTES : This is very good to use for zucchini, broccoli, peppers, green
  beans, onion rings and any other firm vegetable. Barbara Hill says this
  batter WILL stick to the food. FYI: Pancake mix makes a terriffic batter
  for just about anything.  Or use Bisquick or other baking mix prepared
  according to package directions for pancakes. Add milk till the consistency
  reaches that of syrup. Dredge the item in *dry mix* first, shake of excess,
  then dip in batter and let drain for a few seconds; fry at 365Â° for fish or
  chicken nuggets till they float.
