      <step>   Now that you've made a big bowl of refried beans, you're probably
  wondering what to do with them. I always turn them into a big batch of bean
  burritos which can be microwaved on demand for a quick, cheap, filling
  meal.
  
   All ingredients besides the beans and tortillas should be considered
  optional.  Decide what you like in your burritos and add it in.
  
   Get the tortilla wraps to room temperature and separate them.  Make sure
  they can be folded without cracking; if this is a problem it may help to
  warm them in a microwave a bit.
  
   For each burrito:
  
  1.  Lay one tortilla on your working surface.  Spoon exactly one twelfth of
  the bean mixture onto the center of the tortilla in a roughly rectangular
  blob.  Sprinkle some cheese &amp; onion on the bean mixture.
  
  2.  Fold in the tortilla to form the two ends of the burrito.  Fold one of
  the side flaps over the top and around the other side of the bean mix;
  you'll almost tuck it in under the bean mix so as to force the burrito into
  a round shape. Fold the other side over. [If you can't understand what to
  do from these instructions don't sweat it too much; as long as you
  completely enclose the filling you're okay, and it's not hard to figure out
  your own folding method.] Set the burrito aside with these folded sides on
  the bottom.
  
   These freeze quite nicely.  Two of these large ones (or one with side
  dishes) makes a meal.  You could of course make smaller ones using the
  smaller wraps, though I'm not sure how many you'll get.
  
   An excellent variation is to brown a half pound to a pound of ground beef
  or turkey, drain it, and stir it into the refried beans before assembling
  burritos. -- Kenneth Herron kherron@ms.uky.edu University of Kentucky +1
