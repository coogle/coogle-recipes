      <step>  NOTE -- This recipe was written 1747 (Original recipe) "Half a peck of
  flour (5 lbs) will make the walls of a goose-pie ... Raise your crust just
  big enough to hold a large goose; first have a picked dried tongue boiled
  tender enough to peel, cut off the root, bone a goose and a large fowl;
  take half a quarter of an ounce of mace beat fine, a large teaspoonful of
  beaten pepper, three teaspoonfuls of salt; mix all together, season your
  fowl and goose with it, then lay the fowl in the goose, and the tongue in
  the fowl, and the goose in the same form as id whole. Put half a pound of
  butter on the top, and lay on the lid. this pie is delicious, either hot or
  cold, and will keep a great while. A slice of this pye cut down across
  makes a pretty little side dish for supper."
    A splendid centre piece for a party. Unless your pie has to go by train
  to London, like Mr Turner's, there is no need to make such a thick crust.
  However it must be thick enough to keep in the juices as far as possible. I
  recommend a hot-water pastry made with 3 lbs flour. It seems that the
  varieties of poultry in Hannah Glasse's day were not as large as they are
  now, because you need to increase the seasonings (as in ingredients list
  IMH).
  
    To make pastry
    ==============
  
    Bring water to boil with the lard and the salt. As soon as it comes to
  the boil, tip it into the middle of the flour, mixing everything together
  rapidly to a dough with a wooden spoon or electric beater. Leave the dough
  until it can be handled without too much discomfort, but do not let it
  allow to cool. Cut off about a quarter for the lid and put the rest into a
  large hinged pie mould, or even a roasting pan 11Â«" x 9" x 2" as a mould.
   Quickly and lightly push the pastry up the sides of the tin, being careful
  to leave no cracks. If the pastry collapses down into a dismal heap, it is
  a little too hot, so wait and try again. Having put your filling in the
  pie, put on the lid, fixing it with beaten egg, and make a central hole.
  Decorate the top with leaves and roses made from the trimmings.
  
  Before starting the pastry, soak, boil, trim and skin the tongue as usual.
  Bone the goose and the chicken. Prepare the seasonings.
    Proceed as above, putting the tongue inside the chicken inside the goose,
  seasoning as you go. Put the butter  on top and close the pie with the lid
  section which you reserved.
    To bake the pie, put it into a hot oven, mark 7 425F for 20 minutes. then
  lower the heat to Mark 4 350 F and cover the top with brown paper to
  prevent it from becoming too brown too soon. Leave for
        3    hours.
    It is only prudent to check the pie from time to time. Lower the heat if
  it is bubbling away too fast, to mark 3 325F. Towards the end of this time,
  push a larding needle or skewer into the pie through the top central hole;
  if the juices come out very red, leave the pie a little longer. On the
  other hand, if they come out a pale pink, that is all right - the pie
  continues to cook as it cools down (I took mine out of the oven at 1 am.,
  and it was still not quite cold by lunchtime next day, with the juices
  still liquid: it should have been left until the evening with an hour or
  two in the refrigerator to set it properly JG).
