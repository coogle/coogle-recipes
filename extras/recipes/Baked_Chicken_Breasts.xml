    <directions>
      <step>  Rinse chicken breasts and pat dry; place in Crock-Pot.  In a saucepan,
  combine remaining ingredients and heat until smooth and hot.  Pour over
  chicken breasts.  Cover and cook on low setting for 8 to 10 hours.  (I did
  it on higher heat to speed things up. I added boiled potatoes and some
  paprika towards the end.) For the first time ever, I used those frozen
  boneless skinless bags of chicken. NOT BAD! Also, I have never been one to
  cook with soups before: have learned my lesson. Once cooked in this recipe,
  you cannot tell there is canned soup as base for sauce. This is delish!!!

  NOTES :
       I think this could be made in oven or on top of stove.  Hint:
       Rival's recipe
       called for 4 ounces of mushrooms, but I doubled the quantity.  You
       could
       leave them out if you don't like mushrooms.  I had no Cream of
       Chicken soup
       and sub'd Cream of Celery.  It was soooooo goooood that I think
       I'll just
       stick with Celery in the future!!
