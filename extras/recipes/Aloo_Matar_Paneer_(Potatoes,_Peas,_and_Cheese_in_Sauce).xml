  Paneer Cheese You can substitute farmer's cheese if you don't want to make
  your own paneer.
  
  Ingredients
  
      1/2    gallon of milk 2-3 Tbsp lemon juice
  
  Preparation
  
  Put the milk in a stainless steel pot and start boiling it. It's best if
  you stir it with a wooden sppon. You must stir it regularly, to make sure
  it doesn't burn (if it burns, it will be absolutely unusable).
  
  Once the milk is thoroughly boiling, remove the heat and add the lemon
  juice. The milk starts curdling right now. Have another pot ready. Also,
  you'll need a strainer covered with a cheesecloth. Scoop the curds and whey
  into the strainer, dripping the liquids into the pot. The curds should all
  have remained in the cheesecloth. Wrap the cheesecloth so as to cover the
  curds completely. Press the cheesecloth a little bit with your hands or a
  spoon. The point is to squeeze every last bit of whey out of the paneer.
  Makes 1 block of paneer cheese. Posted to EAT-L Digest by Tania Hewes
