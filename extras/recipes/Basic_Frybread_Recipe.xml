      <step>  Mix ingredients and let sit for 10-15 minutes.
  
  Break off a ball of dough about golf ball size and pat out no thicker than
  1/4 inch. (In some tribal traditions a hole is always made in the center
  which has spiritual significance)
  
  Fry in deep hot oil to a light golden brown, turn once to brown both sides.
  (Oil is hot enough if a small test piece of dough dropped in the oil begins
  cooking almost immediately and rises to the top.) Drain bread well and pat
  with paper towel to remove excess oil. Keep covered in a bowl while cooking
  to keep bread warm.
  
  Serving - Usually eaten like bread with soup, stew or posole
  
  Variations - Eat with honey, powedered sugar, cinnamon. Also good with
  strawberries and whipped cream
