    <directions>
      <step>  Mini- Quiche Appetizers: Blend 1/2 cup milk, 2 eggs and 1 (6.5 oz) pkg of
  Alouette. Fill two (2.1 oz) pkgs. mini-phyllo shells and bake at 375~ for
  8-10 minutes or until set. Makes 30 appetizers.
  
  Stuffed Mushrooms: Clean 18 mushrooms and remove stems. Place hollow side
  up on baking sheet. Fill with 1 tsp Alouette and sprinkle with seasoned
  bread crumbs. Bake at 375~ for 12-15 minutes. Garnish and serve.
  
  Alouette French Canapes: Using cookie cutters, cut out shapes of thawed
  puff pastry, brush with beaten egg and bake at 400~ for approx. 5 minutes
  or until golden. Cool and using a decorative tip, pipe on Alouette and
  garnish.
  
  Provencal Flat bread: Spread Alouette on pre-baked 7" gourmet flat bread,
  top with your favorite topping choices such as olives, peppers, sundried or
  cherry tomatoes, artichoke hearts, shrimp or chicken and bake until the
  cheese bubbles. Cut into small wedges and serve as an appetizer. Serves 4.
  
  Entertaining Tips: Surround Alouette with creative accompaniments such as
  spiced nuts, olives, crusty breads, Italian toasts, fresh or marinated
  mushrooms, crudites, etc.
  
  Attractive garnishes are fast, fun and always add appetite appeal and
  color. Try sliced olives, capers, red caviar, pimentos, fresh herbs or
  edible flowers.
  
  For outstanding color and appetite appeal, arrange leaves of purple kale in
  a circle in the center of serving plate. Position the Alouette ramekin cup
  in the center of the kale leaves and surround with colorful vegetables.
  
  Planning your party. Allow 1 pkg of Alouette for every 4 people. Offer
  guests a variety of beverages such as fine wines, wine coolers, aperitives,
  sparkling waters or ciders, freshly squeezed fruit juices, iced teas, etc.
  
  In Summer or warm weather, remember to keep Alouette cool at all times. If
  your party will last several hours, put the Alouette ramekin on ice.
  
  NOTES : I bought the 6.5 oz pkg of Alouette Sundried Tomato et Basil
  gourmet spreadable cheese and all these wonderful recipes and party ideas
  were on the back of the pkg.  There were other flavored cheeses by Alouette
  as well so I imagine you could use any of those flavored cheeses with these
  recipes.
