      <step>   I've prepared a whole turkey on both a gas grill and a Weber charcoal
  grill.  The largest turkey I've been able to prepare is about 14 lbs.
  
   General instructions: Clean turkey well, removing any bits of pin feathers
  and cleaning the cavity of any remaining pieces of innards.  Soften a stick
  of butter to room temperature and rub the cavity with half of the stick of
  butter.  Stuff with your favorite stuffing.  With the remaining butter,
  stuff a little between the skin and the breast meat and rub some over the
  skin of the turkey. Stuff a little bit of the stuffing between the skin and
  the breast also. Skewer the cavity opening shut. Also place a little
  stuffing in the neck cavity, tuck the neck skin under and skewer shut. Salt
  and pepper the turkey and I like to place about three pieces of bacon on
  top of the bird. I know, I know - this is not exactly the most low
  cholesterol way of preparing turkey--but none of us have a problem here and
  we've been eating this way for many, many years.
  
   I've found that instead of using a roasting pan it is easier to use a
  homemade pan from extra heavy duty foil - using three layers of foil and
  making it just big enough to hold the bird and the sides need to be about 2
  1/2" high.
  
   For a gas grill, I have placed the turkey crosswise on the grill so that
  the pan is evenly distributed over the two sets of jets.  Set the flame so
  that a temperature of 300 to 325 degrees is maintained.  On my 44,000btu
  grill, that is about the lowest setting.  Cover with heavy duty foil for
  the majority of the cooking. Time about 20 minutes per pound at 300
  degrees. Remove the foil for the last hour of cooking. Every once in while,
  baste the turkey with the juices (or with the basting juice recipe--to
  follow).  I have "hot spots" in the jets of the grill--so about twice
  during the cooking I turn the turkey around (and the pan, of course) so
  that one side is not more cooked than another.
  
   Basting Juice: Melt the butter in a heavy pot over medium high heat.  Chop
  the onion and saute in the butter until just translucent.  Add the neck and
  the gizzard and continue cooking for about 4 minutes.  Add the rosemary and
  stock and simmer until reduced by half.  Strain well.  Use the gizzard and
  neck in the stuffing or the gravy.  For the basting juice, mix together the
  stock preparation, one half of the marsala and vermouth and the juice of
  one lemon. Use the remaining wine and vermouth and lemon juice if needed. I
  use all of the mixture for a 20 lbs turkey, so I wouldn't think you would
  need to use all of it for a smaller turkey. This really keeps the turkey
  moist and flavorful. BTW, roasting a turkey on the grill - even if you
  don't use this basing juice - makes a very, very flavorful and juicy turkey
  (and whole chicken too).
