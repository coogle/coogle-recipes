  Put all ingredients except the scallions and thyme in a blender (or food
  processor) and puree.  Then add the remaining ingredients and run the
  blender until the ingredients are well mixed, but not pureed.
  
  Makes a little more than 1 cup (enough for about 2 pounds of meat).  Recipe
  scales well.  Sauce can be kept refrigerated for a month, or frozen for a
  "long time".
  
  NOTE: Pickled Habaneros will do just fine if you can't find fresh; but I've
  found that they are not as hot as fresh ones (like maybe half as hot).  You
  could also substitute Habanero-based sauce.  But only use sauce that has a
  low amount of other spices (unless it's allspice).
  
  One of my latest variations uses about 3 Tbs of Alan's Special Mild
  Habanero sauce for flavor; and enough Habaneros or Scotch Bonnet sauce to
  bring the heat up to the right point.
  
  Jamaican jerk is usually made with Scotch Bonnet chiles, which are closely
  related to the Habanero (they are both of the species Capsicum Chinense),
  but harder to find (for me anyway). I'm not sure of the taste differences.
  + To judge the heat, taste when it's all mixed together and add more if you
  want it hotter.  It's hard to tell how hot the final product will be the
  first time you make this, but you will get used to judging the heat
  eventually. For me, the right level is achieved when 1/8 tsp of the jerk
  sauce is enough to make me want water (but I'm used to capsaicin).
