      <step>  Steam asparagus until crisp-tender. Immediate plunge asparagus in ice water
  to stop cooking and to set the color. Drain, and wrap in paper towels.
  (Asparagus may be kept in refrigerator overnight, wrapped in dry paper
  towels and stored in zip-top plastic bags until ready to serve.)
  
  Mix mayonnaise and vinegar in a glass bowl. Cover and refrigerate until
  serving time. May be prepared several days in advance.
  
  To serve, arrange asparagus on a platter with a bowl of dip. Or plate 3 to
  4 speas, drizzled with the dip.
  
  Makes 10 to 12 small servings.
