      <step>  Heat oven to 325 degrees. Using a sharp knife, score surface of ham
  crosswise and lengthwise, forming a crosshatch pattern about 1/4-inch deep
  and 1-inch apart. Place 1 clove in the center of each square. Place ham,
  fat side up, in a double-layer disposable aluminum roasting pan. Pat the
  brown sugar onto the surface of the ham. Expect some sugar to fall into the
  roasting pan. Transfer to oven, and bake until brown sugar just begins to
  melt, about 30 minutes. Pour Coca-Cola over ham, mixing with melted sugar
  in bottom of roasting pan. Baste ham with sugar mixture. Return to oven,
  and bake for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, combine 1 cup reserved pineapple juice
  and wine in a small bowl. Baste ham with pineapple mixture. Bake ham for a
  total of 16 minutes per pound, basting every 20 minutes. During the last 20
  minutes of baking time, decorate ham with pineapple rings. Use 2 to 3
  toothpicks to hold each ring in place. Center a cherry in the center of
  each ring, and adhere with a toothpick. Transfer ham to a platter, removing
  all toothpicks. Garnish ham with fresh bay leaves. Serves 10 to 12. Recipe

  Martha Stewart Living &lt;www.marthastewart.com&gt;. Lynn's notes: Made this for
  Easter 1998; used and 8 lb. butt portion ham. The ham turned out to be very
  tasty and delicious. A lot of basting has to be done, but the results are
  worth it.
