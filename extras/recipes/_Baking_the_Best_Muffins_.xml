      <step>  * measure ingredients carefully and mix just enough to moisten. Don't worry
  if the batter still has a few lumps. Overbeating can make muffins tough.
  
  * If you don't have a nonstick muffin pan, a spritz of nonstick cooking
  spray in the pan or on the papers before filing them will prevent these
  reduced-fat muffins from sticking after they're baked. Remove the papers
  while the muffins are still warm.
  
  * Muffins are best warm from the oven. Reheat any leftovers briefly in the
  microwave.
