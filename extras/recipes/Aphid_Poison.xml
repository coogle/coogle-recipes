  &gt; Are spiders harmful to plants?
  
  No, they are beneficial, since they eat pests which attack/damage plants.
  Except when they are babies, which can confound the picture for maybe a day
  or two, spiders mostly are larger than, say, 1/8" across (finger-to-toe),
  and don't travel in herds. &gt; I recently moved to a new apt, and my &gt; plants
  are now the home to many small spiders.  From what I've read, &gt; these don't
  seem to be spider mites, but I'm not certain.  Spraying &gt; with soap cured
  the problem for about an hour.  Any advice?
  
  Many mites, on the other hand, e.g. spider mites, are in the set of damage
  causers.  Different types of spider mites vary of course, but most are 1mm
  or smaller across (finger-to-toe), and once established tend to exist in
  great population densities, like hundreds per leaf.
  
  There are biological controls for spider mites, including various predatory
  mites.
  
  Mark Andersen &lt;mnanders@ingr.com&gt; wrote on 13Jan96 that aphids and fungus
  gnats are controlled by spraying with a mixture of: 1 C. rubbing alcohol 3
  C. water 1/8 C. Dawn dishwashing detergent
  
  so maybe this will work for spider mites, too.  I'll probably try it this
  year -- last summer spider mites ate up all my eggplant plants.  The life
  cycle of spider mites is such that mite control spray programs usually
  specify spraying at least three times, a week apart.
