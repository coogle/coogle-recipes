      <step>  Baking is probably the most common cooking method, but not necessarily the
  first thing you think of for cooking fish. It is a good choice though
  because it offers a wealth of variety. And you can bake fish with very
  little or no added fat. Unlike the moist heat of steaming or poaching, oven
  heat is dry, so your most important consideration is that the fish remains
  moist while cooking.
  
  There are many ways to do this beginning with an even coating of seasoned
  breadcrumbs or a quick brush with olive oil or melted butter. You can top
  the fish with thinly sliced tomatoes, zucchini, mushrooms or other
  vegetables, which help maintain the moisture in the fish as it cooks. You
  can even oven-poach fish by cooking it either partially or totally
  submerged in fish stock, wine or other liquid, covering the baking dish
  with foil, or laying buttered foil directly on top of the fish pieces.
  Wrapping the fish, in lettuce leaves, parchment paper or foil, is probably
  the best way to keep fish moist as it bakes. This in fact becomes
  oven-steaming because the moisture is sealed in.
  
  Baking is so versatile that virtually any fish or shellfish can be baked,
  from the thinnest fillets to oysters on the half-shell to the largest whole
  fish that your oven can accommodate. Smaller fillets or fish pieces should
  be baked at higher temperatures (about 425øF) to cook more quickly so there
  is less chance of drying out. Large pieces of fish and whole fish should be
  cooked at moderate temperatures (about 350øF) so the heat can penetrate to
  the interior of the fish without overcooking the exterior.
  
                                   How to Bake
  
  1. Preheat the oven. Arrange the fish in an even layer in a lightly oiled
  or buttered baking dish, folding thin ends under if necessary to encourage
  even cooking.
  
  2. Sprinkle the fish with the seasoning, coating, vegetables or whatever is
  called for in your recipe.
  
  3. Bake the fish in the preheated oven until it is opaque through the
  thickest part of the fish. Cooking time will vary depending on the
  thickness of the fish and the accompanying ingredients.
  
  4. Transfer the fish and vegetables, if appropriate, to individual plates.
  If there are any cooking juices remaining in the dish, spoon a little over
  the fish and serve.
