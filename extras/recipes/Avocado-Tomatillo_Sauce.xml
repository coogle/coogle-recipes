      <step>  Since there seems to be something of a "green recipe" thread running
  through the list at the moment, I thought I'd submit a favorite of mine.
  This derives from the "Habanero Cookbook," by Dave DeWitt and Nancy
  Gerlach, where it was introduced as a sauce for fish.
  
  * If using fresh tomatillos, husk them, then boil about 10 min. or until
  soft in unsalted water. Let cool and chop. If using canned tomatillos, they
  can be chopped and added directly to the mix. I prefer the slightly sharper
  taste of fresh ones if you can get them...
  
  Combine avocados, chopped tomatillos, habaneros and garlic in a food
  processor and mix well. Add lime juice and blend until desired consistency
  is reached. Add salt, taste and adjust if necessary.
  
  Depending on the ripeness of the avocados, the juiciness of the tomatillos,
  and the amount of lime juice added, this sauce can vary from chunky and
  pale green to quite runny and dark green. It's very good on top of hearty
  fish like swordfish or tuna, and it's great with chicken, but I've also
  made it alone as a dip for parties.
