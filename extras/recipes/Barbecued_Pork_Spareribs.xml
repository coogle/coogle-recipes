    <directions>
      <step>   Salt and pepper pork ribs. Barbeque ribs on coals until ready. Then baste
  with the sauce.
  
   Mix sauce well. Remove ribs from the coals and quickly apply the tomato
  basting sauce, using a barbeque brush, covering the whole rib on both
  sides. Return ribs to coals and continue barbequeing each side for two
  minutes only.
  
   Remove, cut and serve. The tomato barbeque sauce should be applied to the
  ribs after they have been barbequed to perfection, and each treated side
  barbequed for only 2 minutes more after applying the tomato basting sauce.
  This is the secret of perfectly barbequed pork spareribs: if the sauce is
  applied whilst the meat is still raw, or if a side is facing the coals for
  more than 2 minutes after brushing on the tomato basting sauce, the tomato
  in the sauce tends to turn to charcoal.
