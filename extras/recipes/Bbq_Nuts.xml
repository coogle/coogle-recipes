      <step>  Kit Anderson-- Nuts are very easy to do on a smoker. I have smoked them at
  cooler temps and high temps and they seem the best when done at 300F for
  1/2 hour. That would be over the hot spot in an offset smoker. Any wood
  will do but hickory is especially nice.
  
  Get raw nuts in bulk at your health food store. Almonds, filberts, pecans,
  walnuts, peanuts are all good. The nuts need to be moist in order for the
  smoke to stick. 2 tablespoons of melted butter is right for 1 pound of
  nuts. You can also spray them with Pam. I recently have found 2 tablespoons
  of tamari soy sauce gives a wonderful subtle richness and will hold the
  smoke and spices. This also leaves them with a nice, dry coating. They will
  also need salt. Use a fine grain, not coarse kosher, to taste.
  
  After tossing with butter, tamari, or Pam, add your spices. You can get
  very elaborate or not. I like heat and will sometimes add some hot sauce to
  the butter. Try any of the seasoned salts. One recipe from the chileheads
  list asked for 2 TABLESPOONS of Dave's Insanity in the butter. These were
  hot. No...they were HOT. Weird thing was, that burned cat flavor from
  Dave's had vanished.
  
  Here's my recent effort that got a 'best ever' from the wife.
  
  Toss nuts with tamari in a bowl until completely coated. Add salt to taste
  and chiles. Spray baking sheet with Pam and arrange nuts in a single layer.
  Smoke at 300 for 1/2 hour stirring once after 15 minutes. Allow to
  completely cool so that they will be crunchy. These are great with beer, in
  oatmeal, and on salads.
