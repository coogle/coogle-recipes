      <step>  NB* As usual, the weight of pastry is the weight of flour used to make it.
  
    Roll out the pastry and line a 9" flan ring. Bake blind as usual at a
  high temperature (400 for 8-9 mins weighted down then a futher 2-3 mins
  just to colour lightly). Meanwhile, mash the cheeses together, put into a
  measuring jug and make up to volume with cream or cream and milk. Beat hard
  with the eggs (food processor). Season to taste with salt, pepper and
  cayenne as usual.
    The asparagus should have been peeled/trimmed as usual and boiled in
  strongly salted water until just tender - for really freshly picked
  asparagus &lt;15 minutes will suffice. Immediately remove from water and
  separate on a paper towel to cool quickly. When cold, cut into 2" lengths
  and spread out on the flan base. Pour over the custard and bake in a
  moderate oven (375F) for around 30 minutes until nicely set. Serve warm
  (not cold or too hot).
