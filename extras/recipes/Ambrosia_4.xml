  NOTES:
  
  *  Simple dessert for failed Pavlova attempts -- My mother used to make the
  banana variety of this when she cooked her meringues a little too long or
  too hot. I've no idea of its origins.
  
  *  I can never make up my mind whether I prefer the strawberry or the
  banana version. Peach should be pretty good too, though I've never tried
  it.
  
  *  This is a neat way of saving a Pavlova attempt when the meringue part
  fails:  it produces a delicious desert and no-one need ever know...
  
  : Difficulty:  very simple.
  : Time:  10 minutes presuming you have the meringue available.
  : Precision:  No need to measure.
