      <step>  Heat your oven real hot - 500 to 550F is good. Place asparagus in a single
  layer in a shallow baking disk, drizzle with a bit of olive oil, sprinkle
  with a bit of coarse salt and roast, shaking the disk occasionally until
  the tips are starting to get a bit crunchy. Serve as is or drizzled with a
  little EV olive oil and balsamic or sherry vinegar.

  1) Cook al dente in water, cut into pieces similar in length to the pasta
  in step 3. 2) Heat a couple cups of milk, add a few tablespoons of butter
  and crumble in some imported gorgonzola and parmesan cheese, stirring all
  the time until thick and creamy/saucy. I probably use about 2-3 ounce of
  gorgonzola and a big handful of parmesan, but I just keep adding until it
  tastes right to me. Keep warm 3) Cook some penne, fusilli or other pasta
  shaped sort of like asparagus al dente 4) Toss 1, 2 and 3 together. You can
  pass the cheese sauce through a strainer if you want to remove some of the
  blue veiny stuff from the sauce.
