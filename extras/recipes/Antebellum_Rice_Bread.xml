      <step>  This one is from The Bread Winners Cookbook by Mel London.
  
  This recipe was given to me by an old friend in Savannah, who told me that
  it was a favorite breakfast bread on the plantations.
  
  * The salt, though traditional, may be eliminated if you choose to do so.
  
  Place the melted fats and the rice in a heavy saucepan, covered, over very
  low heat.  Mix cornmeal and salt and pepper, then stir milk into beaten
  eggs and blend in the cornmeal. Blend together with the rice mixture and
  put into greased 8- or 9-inch square pan.
  
  Bake at 450 deg.F. until firm when tapped with finger and well browned on
  top--about 25 minutes.
  
  Cut into squares to serve.
  
  Makes 1 to 1 1/2 dozen squares.
  
  NOTE:  This just looked like an interesting combination... and like
  something that would create a little more (or different) texture.. a fun
  bread.  It almost sounds like it might come out a custardy bread...
