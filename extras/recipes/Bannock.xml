  For bannock, you only have to mix a cup full of flour with a little salt,
  half a tea spoon of baking powder and enough water to make all this become
  sticky. Roll it like a big sausage around a stick (put butter on the stick
  before) and bake on a fire camp untill the bread is golden. You have to do
  this in the woods, of course, with a blanket around the shoulders (it's
  still cold at 6 in the morning...). Have a nice time camping! Brigitte.
