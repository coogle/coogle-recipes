  Recently, there was a request for desserts using fresh herbs.  Here is an
  unusual use of herbs in a dessert...I hope you like it.  I got it from an
  article in a magazine a few years back...I can't remember whether it was
  Vogue or Harper's Bazaar.
  
  This is a creme anglaise, infused with fresh basil and mint.  Serve in a
  pitcher with summer fruits...some suggestions given in the recipe are:
  pitted cherries and red currants, mixed berried with plum, peach and
  nectarine sections and a mixture of various melons. Sprinkle with superfine
  sugar and toss gently. Let stand for at least 30 mins. to form a light,
  natural syrup. Serve the fruit cold, drizzling each portion with some of
  the sauce.
  
  Place the half and half in  a heavy saucepan (not aluminium) over medium
  heat.  Scrape the vanilla seeds into the liquid; add the vanilla pod and
  bring to a boil.
  
  Place the egg yolks, sugar, and salt in a bowl; whisk until combined.  Very
  gradually whisk the hot liquid into the egg-yolk mixture.  Return to the
  saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon
  until the custard lightly coats the back of the spoon, usually 5-8 minutes.
  Do not allow to boil. Remove from the heat and strain. Let cool.
  
  Bring a small pan of water to the boil.  Add the basil and mint leaves;
  blanch for 30 seconds.  Drain and immediately plunge the herbs into a bowl
  of ice water (this will set the green colour). Remove the herbs from water
  and gently press out excess water. Place the cooled custard and the herbs
  in a blender and puree. Add Chartreuse to taste and transfer to a glass
  pitcher. Keep the custard refrigerated, covered with plastic wrap. Makes 2
      1/3    cups (6-8 servings).
  
  This recipe was created by a chef called Gary Danko.  He claims this sauce
  is also perfect with a chocolate mousse cake... I think he is right!!  In
  fact, I think it would go quite nicely also with a rich chocolate parfait.
