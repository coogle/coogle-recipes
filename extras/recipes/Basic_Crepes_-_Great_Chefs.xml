    <directions>
      <step>       Combine the flour, sugar, eggs, and milk and beat until smooth. The
  resulting batter should be the consistency of thin cream.
  
       Add oil to the batter and mix lightly.
  
       Grease an 8-inch crepe pan or frying pan lightly with butter and heat
  until the butter is quite hot but not burned.
  
       Ladle about 1/3 cup (or a bit less) of the batter into the pan and
  rotate the pan to spread the batter evenly. Cook the crepe until it looks
  firm and is lightly browned at the edges (about 1 minute) then turn the
  crepe over with a thin spatula or your fingers and cook the other side for
  about 30 seconds.
  
       Grease the pan with a bit more butter about every other crepe, or when
  the crepes begin to stick.
  
       Repeat until the batter is gone.
