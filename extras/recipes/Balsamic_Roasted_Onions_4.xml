      <step>  Preheat the oven to 375 F. Remove the outermost layer of onion skin, spray
  the onions with cooking spray, and sprinkle them with salt and pepper.
  Place the onions close together in a baking dish and roast, uncovered,
  about 1 1/2 hours, until tender when pricked with a fork. (The onions will
  release their juices while roasting and should be soft but not mushy.)
  
  Remove the onions from the pan and set aside. Add the water to the baking
  dish and stir to loosen and collect the pan juices; transfer to a small
  saucepan. Add the vinegar and cook over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes,
  reducing the mixture to about 1/4 cup syrup.
  
  Cut the onions in half lengthwise and brush the cut surface generously with
  the syrup, allowing it to sink down into the layers. Sprinkle with salt and
  pepper to taste and serve.
