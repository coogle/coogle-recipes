      <step>   Cut the squash in half lengthwise. Discard the seeds and membrane and
  place the squash cut-side down on a lightly oiled baking dish. Bake at 350
  degrees until the squash is still firm, but tender enough to easily scoop
  out with a spoon, about 45 minutes.
  
   After the squash has been baking about 25 minutes, place the chopped
  almonds in a pie tin or another small ovenproof container and bake until
  they turna toasty light brown (10-15 minutes). Check boththe almonds and
  the sqash occasionally so you will know when they are done.
  
   Heat the olive oil in a large skillet. Add the onions and the thyme. Saute
  over low heat until the onions are well done. Add the cooked barley,
  tamari, and toasted almonds to the sauteed onions.
  
   Using a small spoon, scoop bite-sized chunks out of the cooked squash,
  leaving enough flesh around the shell so that it stays strong enough to
  hold its shape. Add the scooped out squash to the barley mixture. Mix well.
  Fill the empty squash shells with this mixture, mounding it as high as
  possible.
  
   Place the stuffed squash in a baking dish. Cover with aluminum foil and
  bake at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes.
