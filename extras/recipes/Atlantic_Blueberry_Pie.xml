      <step>  Phillip Graebing wrote that he had lost his blueberry recipes. I have a
  cookbook called "The Blueberry Connection" - 209 pages of nothing but
  blueberry recipes. Being it's that time of the year, hopefully some of the
  following will refresh Phillip's files
  
  Dissolve gelatin in boiling water. Add sugar, juice and lemon rind. Chill
  until syrupy. Whip chilled milk. Fold berries and whipped milk into chilled
  syrup mixture. Pour into baked pie shell. Chill. Ymmmy! "The cultivated
  blueberry has been on the market for only about 45 years. It is, indeed, a
  20th century child."
