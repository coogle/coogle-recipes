  From: theservs@gate.net (Thomas E. Haug)
  Stir together 1 3/4 cups flour, yeast, and salt in a large mixer bowl. Heat
  milk, water, butter, and sugar until very warm (120 to 130 F). Add liquid
  ingredients to flour mixture; beat until smooth, about 2 minutes on electnc
  mixer. Add egg and 1/2 cup more flour and beat another 2 minutes. Gradually
  add enough more flour to make a soft dough. Turn out onto floured board;
  continue to work in flour until dough can be kneaded. Knead until smooth
  and elastic, but still soft (about 5 minutes). Cover; let rest about 20
  minutes. Shape, let rise, and bake as directed in recipes that follow.
  
  Cinnamon Rolls: Roll dough into a 13x9-inch rectangle. Spread with 2
  tablespoons softened butter or margarine. Sprinkle with mixture of 1/2 cup
  firmly packed brown or white sugar and 2 teaspoons cinnamon.  Beginning
  with long side, roll dough up tightly jelly-roll fashion. Cut roll into 12
  (1-inch) slices. Place slices in a greased 13x9x2-inch baking pan or
  greased muffin cups. Bake at 375 F 15 to 20 minutes.
  
  Glazed Raised Doughnuts: Follow recipe for Basic Sweet Dough. Roll out to
  about l/2-inch thickness. Cut with doughnut cutter or make into shape of
  your choice, such as squares, twists, long johns, doughnut holes, or
  bismarcks. Let rise, uncovered, until light, 40 to=7F 50 minutes. Fry in
  deep hot oil (375 F) 3 to 4 minutes, turning once. Drain on paper towels.
  Dip in a glaze of 1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar, 2 tablespoons warm
  water, and I teaspoon vanilla extract.
