  Preheat oven on 175 oC. Beat egg and mix with sugar and almonds.  Put
  little heaps of batter (tsp sized) on a greased tray. They need to be about
  8 cm apart. Flatten the heaps with a fork. Bake in oven for 10 - 15
  minutes. Remove from oven and leave on tray for 3 minutes. Remove cookies
  from tray with a palette knive. Immediately after removing a cookie from
  the tray, wrap it around a wooden stick. Leave cookies to cool around
  stick. Store in airtight container, or even better eat them ! Eet
  smakelijk.  Hanneke
