    <directions>
      <step>  In a medium saucepan, heat milk to 180Ã¸. Place lid on saucepan and let
  rest=0Afor 10 minutes. Remove lid and when temperature gets to 150, whisk
  in instant=0Amilk powder. Pour into a glass jar( I use a wide-mouth canning
  jar). When=0Atemperature reaches 130, add 2 Tbsp. yogart. DO NOT STIR! Wrap
  in a large=0Akitchen towel and place in cooler, undisturbed for 9-24 hours.
  ( I use an=0Ainsulated lunch bag) Refrigerate for at least 6 hours. The
  mixture is very=0Arich and thick but very TART! You can add honey or fresh
  fruit, as desired. I have never tried it, but next time I am planning to
  use vanilla beans and=0Ainfuse with the milk in the 1st step. How do you
  think it will work. Please=0Adon't be intimidated by the directions, they
  are easy, fast and a great=0Alearning project.
  
  I love using homemade yogart in recipes like waffles, pancakes,
  cornbread,=0Amuffins, cakes, and yeast breads.
