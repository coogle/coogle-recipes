  I was requested to submit this recipe here. This is a very common Filipino
  dish and very practical for tropical countries because of the lack of
  electricity and appliances in villages and it can keep for days without
  refrigeration. This dish however has become one of the Philippine favorites
  even in cities and towns.
  
  Combine all ingredients in a caserole and bring to a boil. Bring heat to
  medium and simmer until meat is very tender. Some would transfer the dish
  to a wok and fry the dish in its own oil until the pork and chicken are
  shredded. Serve with rice. Most families do this purely with pork. For
  variation it is also good to include chicken slices. This they call
  Chicken-Pork Adobo.
