      <step>  Wash beans, cover with water and soak for 6 - 8 hours. Put kombu on bottom
  of pot and cover with the squash. Next add soaked, drained beans. Add water
  to just cover the squash layer. Do not cover the beans at the beginning.
  
  Place the bean mixture over low heat and bring to a boil slowly. Cover
  after about 10 - 15 minutes. Cook until beans are 70 - 80% done, about 1
  hour or so. The water will evaporate as the beans expand, add more cold
  water as required to keep level constant and make beans soft. When beans
  are nearly done, add sea salt, cook another 15 - 30 minutes.
  
  Transfer to serving bowl. Serve with brown rice.
