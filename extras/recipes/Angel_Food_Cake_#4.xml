  Sift the flour, sugar, and salt together 3 times. Beat the egg whites with
  the cream of tartar, slowly at first, then increasing the speed. When the
  whites are quite frothy, slowly sift in the sugar, beating hard, until firm
  peaks form. Slowly sift the flour over the whites.
  
  Turn into the ungreased tube pan and bake in an oven preheated to 325 for
  about 50 minutes, until the cake browns well and is slightly resistant to
  the touch. Cool inverted over a rack. Loosen sides and bottom, if
  necessary, with a thin knife or spatula to free the cake. Serve at room
  temperature.
  
  SNOWBALLS:Tear an Angel Food Cake (above) into balls about the size of an
  egg using 2 forks. Coat each ball with whipped cream and roll in freshly
  grated coconut. Chill well before serving. This very old and clever use of
  leftover or slightly stale cake is generally adored by children, especially
  in the heat of summer. Often it is served at birthday parties with a candle
  in each serving, a play on fire and ice.
  
  CHOCOLATE ANGEL FOOD CAKE--15-18 servings:  Make the Angel Food Cake
  (above) recipe, but in place of 1 cup flour, use 3/4 cup flour and 1/3 cup
  cocoa.
  
  Sift flour and cocoa together 3 times. Proceed as for regular Angel Food
  Cake. When cool and turned out, split twice for 3 layers. Ice between
  layers and over outside with Two Whiskey Chocolate Mousse (see recipe).
