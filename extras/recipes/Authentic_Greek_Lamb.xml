      <step>  Ingredients:
  
  Leg of lamb many cloves of garlic lots of oregano and
  pepper lots of lemon juice a bit of salt
  Place many cloves of garlic under the skin/into the
  meat all around the leg.  Sprinkle lots of oregano,
  pepper, lots of lemon juice, and a bit of salt on to
  the meat.  Cover with aluminum foil &amp; bake.  The meat
  should still be brown/pink when done (Approx 1.5 hrs).
  I like to uncover the last 1/2 hour to get a crust on
  the leg. Converted by MMCONV vers. 1.40
