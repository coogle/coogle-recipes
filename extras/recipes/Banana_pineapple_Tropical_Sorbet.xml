    <directions>
      <step>  Because this sorbet is frozen in the pineapple shell, you must cut out the
  flesh according to the following special method. First, slice off the top,
  just at the point where the edges begin to straighten. Now stand the
  pineapple up on its bottom end. Insert a long, thin-bladed knife into the
  exposed flesh, next to the pineapple's outer skin. Push the knife in tin
  the entire length of the pineapple, stopping just above the bottom -
  CAREFUL - you don't want to penetrate through the bottom. Cut in a circle
  around the edge just inside the skin. You've now created a long cylinder of
  pineapple flesh that's connected to the shell only at the bottom.
  
  To separate the bottom of this fruit cylinder, insert the knife into the
  side of the pineapple, about 1 inch from the bottom. Without enlarging the
  hole that is the knife's entry point into the fruit, fan the blade back and
  forth, cutting through the inside fruit cylinder in a large "V". Repeat
  this procedure on the opposite side. Now the long, central p pineapple
  cylinder is free.
  
  Invert the pineapple over a bowl to catch the juice. Plunge a fork into the
  pineapple cylinder's top end and, with firm determination, pull it out into
  the bowl. Remove the tough central core of the fruit by cutting the
  cylinder into quarters and then trimming off the center strip of eac each
  piece. Remove any "eyes".
  
  Roughly chop the remaining pineapple flesh and put it into the bowl with
  the reserved juice. The rest is easier!!
  
  Puree pineapple flesh and juice with bananas in food processor, gradually
  adding the sugar, yogurt and honey. Transfer to ice cream maker and process
  according to directions. Scoop sorbet into hollowed out pineapple shell,
  cover with plastic wrap and freeze for at least an hour.
  
  To serve: Remove from freezer just before serving. Slice the pineapple from
  top to bottom into 6 wedges.
  
  Of course, one needn't go to all that trouble...but it's a lovely way to
  present the sorbet. If you don't want to do it, then skip all the hard
  part, and just chop up the pineapple flesh and go from there and serve
  directly out of the ice cream maker!! :)
  
  This will also get posted in the low fat topic, as it only has 1 gm of fat
  per serving.....
