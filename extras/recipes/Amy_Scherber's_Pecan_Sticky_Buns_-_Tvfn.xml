      <step>  Equipment: One 9-inch square baking pan, preferably non-stick, buttered on
  sides only; one sheet pan, lined with aluminum foil Place the yeast and
  warm water in a small bowl and stir with a fork to dissolve the yeast.
  Allow it to stand for about 3 minutes. Mix the flour and salt together in a
  large bowl. Add the warm water and the yeast mixture and stir with your
  fingers to moisten the flour, scraping the sides of the bowl and folding
  the dough over itself until it gathers into a shaggy mass. Move the dough
  to a lightly floured surface and knead it by hand for 5 minutes. This is a
  soft, moist dough. If the dough seems too stiff and hard to knead, add
  extra warm water 1 tablespoon at a time until you get a nice malleable
  dough. Gently shape the dough into a loose ball, cover it with plastic, and
  let it rest on the table for 20 minutes. (This rest period is the
  autolyse.) Gently knead the dough on the lightly floured surface for 1to 2
  more minutes, or until it becomes smooth, supple, and elastic but not too
  firm. The texture of the dough should be soft but springy. Shape the dough
  into a loose ball, place it in a lightly oiled bowl, and turn to coat the
  top with oil. Cover it tightly with plastic wrap and let it rise at room
  temperature (75 to 77 degrees F) until it has doubled in volume, about 1
  1/2 to 2 hours. While the dough is rising; in a small saucepan, heat the 9
  tablespoons butter and the dark brown sugar over low heat, stirring
  occasionally, until the butter has melted and the sugar is completely
  moistened (it won't be dissolved), then whisk until the mixture looks silky
  and a little lighter in color. Use 1 tablespoon softened butter to grease
  the sides of a 9-inch square pan, then pour in the caramel, tilting the pan
  slightly so the mixture spreads evenly over the bottom of the pan. Sprinkle
  the toasted pecans over the warm caramel and press them down slightly. Put
  the pan in the refrigerator to cool the caramel; be the pan's on a level
  surface. Put the granulated sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl and stir
  until evenly mixed. Set aside. When the dough has doubled, gently pour it
  out of the bowl onto the floured work surface. Flatten the dough and
  stretch it with your fingers to form a 13 by 10-inch rectangle, with a long
  side facing you. Work gently so you don't tear the dough surface. The dough
  should stretch easily at this point, but if it resists, let it rest for 5
  minutes and resume stretching. Check to be sure the dough isn't sticking to
  the work surface; flour the table again, if necessary. Spread 3 tablespoons
  of the softened butter evenly over the the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch strip
  unbuttered along the top edge. Sprinkle the cinnamon/sugar mixture
  generously and evenly over the butter, again leaving the top 1/2-inch of
  the rectangle bare. Starting with the bottom edge, roll up the dough
  jelly-roll fashion into a long log. If the dough sticks to the table as
  you're rolling, use a dough scraper to loosen it gently. Pinch gently but
  firmly along the seam to seal it. If necessary, gently shape the roll so it
  is a nice uniform log. Take the caramel-lined pan out of the refrigerator.
  Cut the log of dough into 9 equal pieces. (It's easiest to mark the roll
  first to show where you're going to make the cuts--a slight indentation
  with the knife edge will do--then use a sharp serrated knife to cut
  completely through the dough.) Lay the pieces cut side down on top of the
  caramel. Don't worry if it's a tight fit. Let rise, uncovered, at room
  temperature until the dough has almost doubled, about 1 to 1 1/4 hours. The
  rolls should fill the pan and extend 1/2 to 3/4-inch above it. In the
  meantime, position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to
  375 degrees F. Put the pan of sticky buns on a foil-lined baking sheet and
  place it in the oven. Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature
  to 350 degrees F and bake for 30 to 40 minutes longer, until the tops of
  the buns are golden brown and crusty. It's important to bake the buns long
  enough so the dough is cooked all the way through and the caramel topping
  develops properly. Set the pan of buns on a rack to cool for 5 minutes.
  Then quickly but carefully turn the pan upside down and release the sticky
  buns onto a large flat heatproof plate. Immediately scrape out any hot
  caramel remaining in the bottom of the pan and spread it on the tops of the
  buns, filling in any bare spots. Let them cool until just warm before
  serving. (Clean the pan by soaking it in very hot water to dissolve the
  caramel.) Store any leftovers covered in plastic wrap at room temperature.
