      <step>  OVEN: 375 Foil lined cookie sheets
  
  Measure first 6 ingredients into the bowl.
  
  Mix til a soft dough is formed. Divide dough into 12 pieces.
  
  OUTLINES FOR COOKIES: Roll the dough between hands making snake shapes
  about 1/4- inch thick. Place rope on prepared cookie sheet and form into a
  design. (Shapes like dreidles, Jewish stars, etc...)
  
  NOTE: Be sure dough ends are completely pinched together as these will form
  the outline of the stained glass picture.
  
  Sprinkle the crushed candies inside the dough outlines, filling the spaces
  completely and heaping slightly.
  
  Carefully insert a craft stick into cookie, forming a "lollipop."
  
  Bake in oven for 8 to 10 minutes, watching carefully. Remove cookie sheets
  from oven and place on counter to cool.
  
  When cooled, gently peel off foil from each cookie pop. You will have
  created a beautiful created a stained glass effect!
  
  Wrap each cookie pop in plastic wrap.
  
  For gift giving, tie with a colorful ribbon.
  
  These cookies can easily be made by children (with careful supervision.)
