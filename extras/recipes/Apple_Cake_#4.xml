  Melt the lard in a saucepan and let it cool.  Cut the apples in quarters
  and remove the cores and skin, then cut into thin slices. Place the apple
  slices in a bowl and sprinkle the lemon juice over them. Place 1 cup of the
  flour in a second bowl and make a well in it. Dissolve the yeast in the
  water and pour it into the well; stir with a wooden spoon. Add the sugar,
  melted lard, grated lemon peel and eggs, and when these ingredients are all
  well incorporated, sprinkle in the remaining flour. Stir very well, until
  the dough is smooth and very soft, then add the soaked raisins (I left them
  out cause I didn't have any) and half the apple slices, mixing them in
  well.
  
  Place the dough in an oiled cake mold or springform pan and arrange the
  remaining apple slices on top.  Cover with a dish towel and let the dough
  rise until it is almost doubled in bulk.
  
  When the dough has risen, remove the towel and bake in a preheated 400F
  oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the top of the cake is golden brown.
  Let the cake cool for 30 minutes before turning out.
