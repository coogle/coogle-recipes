  Mix cubed chicken with coconut milk, chili paste, peppers and cilantro.
  Allow to sit for at least an hour to absorb flavours.
  
  Then, taking a cube of chicken (or two, depending on size), center it in a
  wonton skin,gather the four corners of the skin with your fingers moistened
  in the cornstarch paste, and twirl the skin until the dumpling looks like a
  Hershey's Kiss.
  
  Allow these to rest on waxed paper or a cookie sheet sprayed with PAM. Deep
  fry these in sufficient oil to cover, a few at a time.  I use peanut oil
  but anything that can take a high heat is fine. Olive oil smokes too much.
  
  Remove from hot oil when they float and are golden brown. Be careful, they
  cook very fast.
  
  I usually provide a peanut sauce to dip these in but they're fine by
  themselves
  
  I do not use exact measurements when I cook, so the above are only
  approximations of what I use. If it looks right, it probably will be fine.
  
  These work out great for parties, too.
