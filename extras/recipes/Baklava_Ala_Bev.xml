      <step>  Recipe by: Beverly R. Salinger *Note: Phyllo dough can be bought
  pre-packaged in your frozen dessert section of the grocery store. This is
  the trickiest part of making Baclava, keeping the layers from drying out:
  
  1). Keep dough under a clean, moist kitchen towel to prevent drying as you
  work with it. Trim it to fit your baking dish, overlapping smaller pieces.
  
  2). Once assembled, cut thru the top 1/2 of the layers BEFORE baking to
  make cutting easier upon completion.
  
  3). Spoon on the hot honey while the dessert is still hot so they can be
  absorbed into the layers as they cool.
  
  DIRECTIONS: Grease a 13" x 9" baking dish. In a large bowl with a spoon,
  mix chopped wanuts, sugar, cinammon until blended. Cut phyllo into 13 x 9"
  rectangles. In a baking dish, place one sheet of phyllo; brush with butter.
  Repeat with 5 more layers, brushing each with butter, and sprinkle with one
  cup of nut mixture.
  
  Place one sheet of phyllo over the nut mixture, brush with butter. Repeat
  with at least 6 layers, overlapping if necessary. Sprinkle with 1 cup nut
  mixture. Repeat layering two more times.
  
  Place remaining phyllo on top of last walnut layer; brush with butter. With
  a sharp knife, cut 1/2-way thru the layers in triangle patterns to make 24
  servings (make 12 squares, then cut them in half diagonally). Bake in 300
  oven until golden brown, about 1 hour, 25 minutes. Meanwhile, in a saucepan
  over medium heat, heat honey until hot but not boiling. Spoon honey over
  baklava. Cool in pan at least one hour and then cut thru remaining layers
  and serve.
  
  Per serving: 255 cals. I don't want to know fat grams!
  
  THIS IS VERY RICH!!!!!
