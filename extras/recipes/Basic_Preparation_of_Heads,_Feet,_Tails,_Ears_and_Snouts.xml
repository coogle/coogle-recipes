      <step>  One or both of these first two steps is required in all the recipes
  that follow.
  
  Step I: Cleaning
  
  Remove any hairs on heads, feet, tails, ears or snouts by singeing
  over an open flame or plucking.  Scrub well (using a vegetable brush
  if desired) and then sprinkle with salt, rubbing it into the skin.
  Rinse well with cool water; pat dry.  Remove any excess fat.  Poultry
  feet (chicken, duck or turkey) must be stripped of their outer scaly
  skin; plunge them in boiling water for 1 minute, as you would do
  before peeling tomatoes. Proceed with recipe.
  
  Step II: Parboiling
  
  Parboil in salted water (1 teaspoon salt for each quart water) for 5
  minutes.  Drain, discarding water.  This step serves the propose of
  ridding the meat of running blood as well as clinging meat, fat or
  bone residue, thereby adding clarity to sauces.

  Allen and Margret Gin.  101 Productions.  San Francisco, 1974.
