      <step>  with the cornstarch wash. Brush gently so you won't deflate the loaves.
  (Reserve the remaining cornstarch wash.) Shake the peel or pan gently to be
  sure the loaves aren't sticking and slide the dough onto the baking stone.
  Quickly pour 1 cup of very hot water into the water pan and immediately
  shut the door. After 1 minute, using a plant sprayer, mist the top and
  sides of the oven 6 to 8 times, then immediately shut the oven door. Repeat
  the misting procedure 1 minute later.
  
  Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature 350 degrees F and
  bake for 20 to 25 minutes longer, until the loaves are golden brown and the
  surface feels firm but not hard when you press it lightly. These should
  have a thin soft crust, not a hard crunchy one. Transfer the loaves to a
  rack and paint them again with the cornstarch wash. Allow to cool
  completely before serving. This bread is best eaten the day it is baked,
  but it also freezes exceptionally well if you wrap it in alu minum foil and
  then a heavy duty plastic freezer bag. Thaw at room temperature before
  serving.
  
  Yield: 2 - 1 1/4-pound loave
