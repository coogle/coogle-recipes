    <directions>
      <step>  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
  
  Combine all the dry ingredients in a large bowl.  Cut the butter into small
  bits and stir them into the dry ingredients, using your finger tips to make
  sure its well combined. (Note:I used a pastry cutter.worked just as well as
  my fingers and lot less messy.) Next,slowly add the milk to the mixture
  while stirring continually. Once the milk has been added, knead the dough
  for one minute until smooth. Roll the dough out to quarter inch thickness.
  Cut into squares and place on a dry cookie sheet. Place the cookie sheet on
  the middle shelf. Bake for 12 minutes and feel secure in knowing that you
  have passed on a small piece of America's heritage on to your children.
