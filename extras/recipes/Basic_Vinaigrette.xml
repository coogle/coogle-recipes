  Put together in a jar and shake well,  Store in refrigerator.  Shake
  vigorously to mix oil and vinegar before using some on a salad.  I prefer
  to add salt to the salad itself at the last minute rather than include it
  in the dressing. Somehow that tastes batter to me. This will keep for at
  least a month, gradually changing character so that each salad is a little
  different than the last. If it gets a little heavy on the vinegar with use,
  add a bit more olive oil late in the game.
