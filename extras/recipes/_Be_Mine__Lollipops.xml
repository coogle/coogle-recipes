      <step>  Source: Better Homes and Gardens, Febuary 1998 Prep time: 20 minutes Cook:
  6 to 8 minutes
  
  Place unwrapped hard candies in a heavy plastic bag, then place bag on top
  of folded towel and crush candies into small chunks wiht meat mallet or
  small hammer.
  
  Make only three or four lollipops at one time. Line a baking sheet with
  foil. Place desired cookie cutters on foil, at least 2 inches apart. Divide
  crushed candies evenly among cutters, approximately 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons
  per lollipop. Candy layer should be 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick. Add small
  decorative candies or edible rose or other flower petals to crushed
  candies. (If using flower petals, make sure they are covered with a layer
  of the crushed candy.)
  
  Bake in a 350 degree oven for 6 to 8 minutes or till candies are completely
  melted. Col 30 seconds. Remove cookie cutters with tongs, allowing melted
  candy to spread slightly.
  
  Quickly attach a stick to base of each lollipop, twisting the stick to
  cover lollipop end with melted candy. If desired, press more small candies
  or flower petals into hot lolipops. Cool. Peel foil from lollipops. Makes 8
