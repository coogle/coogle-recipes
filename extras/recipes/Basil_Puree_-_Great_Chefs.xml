      <step>       Puree the basil with 1/2 cup of olive oil.  Cover with a bit of
  olive oil and refrigerate for up to two weeks if desired.  (The length
  of time the basil is in oil helps to diffuse the flavor into the oil.
  On the other hand, after two weeks, the fresh basil begins to lose its
  bouquet, and taste to natural spoilage.
  
       Discard after 6 weeks and start fresh.
