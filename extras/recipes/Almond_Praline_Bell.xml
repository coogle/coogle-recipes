      <step>   1. Preheat oven to 300F. Butter inside of 9", 10-cup decorative mold; or
  use a 10-cup bowl. Grease a large cookie sheet. On another cookie sheet,
  toast almonds until golden brown - about 20 minutes. In blender or food
  processor, grind almonds (makes 1 1/2 cups).
   2. In a heavy, 3-quart saucepan, combine granulated sugar, brown sugar,
  honey and water. Cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, until sugar is
  dissolved.
   3. Cook, uncovered and without stirring, to 300F on candy thermometer, or
  until a few drops of syrup in cold water form hard, brittle threads.
   4. Remove from heat; add butter and ground almonds.
   5. Pour into prepared cookie sheet. Using the 2 lemon halves and working
  quickly, smooth out and push from the center to the edge of the cookie
  sheet until the brittle is 1/8" thick.
   6. Lift brittle off the sheet before it is completely cooled and hardened,
  and mold it against the inside of prepared mold.
   7. Cool completely - about 2 hours. Unmold just before it is to be served.
   8. To unmold: With spatula, carefully loosen candy from pan; remove. Makes
        1    large bell.
   Note: Leftover pieces can be kept in a closed jar at room temperature, or
  wrapped in aluminum foil.
