    <directions>
      <step>  Put the tepid water in your electric mixer bowl and dissolve the yeast. Use
  a paper lunch sack for weighing out the flour. Put the whole-wheat and rye
  flour in the bag first, and then make up the weight with the white flour.
  Put 4 cups from the bag into the mixer and whip it for 10 minutes. Add the
  salted water. If you have a KitchenAid, allow the dough hook to do the rest
  of the work. Otherwise, add remaining flour by hand. Knead until the dough
  is smooth and elastic. Put the dough on a plastic counter and cover with an
  inverted steel bowl. Allow it to rise once, punch it down, and allow it to
  rise a second time. Punch down and form into 2 or 3 loaaves. I never use
  bread pans for this, as they will ruin the crust. Place the loaves on
  baking sheets that have been dusted with cornmeal and allow the loaves to
  rise until double in bulk. Bake in a 450 degree oven about 25 minutes, or
  until the crust is golden and the loaf light to the touch. It should make a
  hollow sound when you thump your finger on the bottom of the loaf.
  
  Serving Ideas : Makes 2 or 3 loaves.
  
  NOTES : See Italian Breadsticks and Crustulum (Bruschetta) for other ways
  to use this bread recipe.
