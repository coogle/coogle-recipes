      <step>  1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
  
  2. Separate the bacon slices. Place the brown sugar in a shallow bowl.
  Spread one side of each bacon slice with a thin layer of honey mustard. Dip
  both sides of each bacon slice in the brown sugar to coat thoroughly.
  
  3. Place the bacon on a rack over a pan to catch the drippings. (If smaller
  hors dâ€™ oeurves are desired, cut the slices into halves or thirds&gt;0
  
  4. Bake in the upper third of the oven for 20 minutes. Finish browning the
  bacon under the broiler, watching closely.
  
  5. Let cool slightly but not too long or the bacon will stick to the rack.
  Transfer to paper towels to drain. Serve at room temperature.
  
  NOTE: The bacon can be made in advance and refrigerated, but it must be
  reheated to melt the chilled fat and then cooled to room temperature before
  cooking. Make 6 to 8 servings Source: Silver Palate Good Times Cookbook
