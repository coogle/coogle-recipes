      <step>  Wrap scrubbed,dried, pricked potatoes in aluminum foil and bake at 400° for
  1 hour or until well done. While potatoes are baking, brown beef and onion
  lightly. When potaotes are done, cut in halves lengthwise right through the
  foil. Scoop out the inside, mash well and add seasonings. Drain off excess
  fat from meat. Combine meat and potato mixtures. Return to shells. Top with
  shredded cheese. Bake at 400° for 20 minutes or until cheese is nicely
  melted. MC formatting by bobbi744@sojourn.com
  
  NOTES : Anthony Quinn says that he is a very good cook. His food passions
  are for Mexican and Italian food. This dish was invented once when he was
  living on a little farm in Connecticut and  had to feed 30 people He had
  lots of potatoes and not much else in the house.  He thinks it is his best
  dish he ever invented.
