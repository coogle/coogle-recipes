  Here is a recipe for 'newbies'.  It is almost impossible to foul up. Works
  everytime on just about anything.  This recipe calls for steak, but it will
  work equally well for poultry, pork, lamb, hamburgers, and last but not
  least Western Diamondback Rattlesnake. Will work with gas, briquettes,
  hobo-ques, coal, charcoal on any type of grill from a hibachi, Ghengis Kahn
  cooker, to a Brinkmann Professional. Can be made up in bulk, using hundreds
  of steaks or for just a quiet bbq for two.
  
  Yes, it has been tested very thoroughly and believe me if you are looking
  for success in bbq'in this is the one.  Enjoy!!
  
  1. Pound steak on both sides with a wooden mallet or the edge of a heavy
  plate.
  
  2. Combine lemon juice and mustard and spread over both sides of steak.
  Allow to stand 4-5 hours at room temperature.
  
  3. Broil steaks about 4 inches above glowing coals on barbecue grill for
  4-5 minutes on each side, or until desired degree of doneness is achieved.
  You won't taste the lemon juice or mustard as such - just a very good and
  flavorful steak.
