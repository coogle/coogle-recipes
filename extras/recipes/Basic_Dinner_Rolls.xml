      <step>  	   Melted margarine/butter if 	 Desired
  
  In large bow;, combine 2 cups flour, sugar, salt and yeast; blend well. In
  small saucepan, heat water, milk and 1/2 cup margarine until very warm
  (120-130 F.). Add warm liquid and egg to flour mixture. Blend at low speed
  until moistened; beat 3 minutes at medium speed. By hand, stir in an
  additional 2 1/2 to 3 cups flour until dough pulls clenaly away from sides
  of bowl. On floured surface, knead 1 1/4 to 1 3/4 cups flour until dough is
  smooth and elastic, about 8 to 10 minutes. Place dough in greased bowl;
  cover loosely with plastic wrap and cloth towel. Let rise in warm place (80
  to 85 F.) until light and doubled in size, about 45 to 60 minutes. Punch
  down dough several times to remove all air bubbles. Divide dough in half.
  To make PAN ROLLS, lightly grease two 13x9-inch pans. Divide each half of
  dough into 16 equal pieces. Shape each into a ball, pulling edges under to
  make a smooth top. PLace balls, smooth side up, in greased pans. Cover; let
  rise in warm place until light and doubled in size, about 20-30 minutes.
  Heat oven to 400 F. Uncover dough. Bake at 400 F. for 16 to 20 minutes or
  until golden brown. Remove rolls from pans immediately; cool on wire racks.
  Brush with melted margarine.
  
  TIP: To make dough a day ahead, after first rise time, punch down dough,
  cover and refrigerate dough overnight. Shape dough as directed in recipe;
  let rise a second time until light and doubled in size, about 25 to 35
  minutes. Source: The Complete Pillsbury Book of Baking
