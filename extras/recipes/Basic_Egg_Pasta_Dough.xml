      <step>  Recipe by: Northern Italian Cooking Put flour on a pastry board and make a
  well in the center. Break the eggs into well; beat with a fork. Draw some
  flour from inner rim of well over eggs, beating constantly. Keep adding
  flour a little at a time until you have a soft dough. Put dough aside. With
  a pastry scraper, remove bits and pieces of dough attached to board.
  Lightly flour board and your hands. Knead dough 10 to 12 minutes, adding
  flour a little at a time until dough is smooth and pliable. Insert a finger
  into center of dough.  If it comes out almost dry, dough is ready for pasta
  machine.  If dough is sticky, knead it a little longer adding more flour.
  Cut an egg-size piece from dough.  Wrap remaining dough in a cloth towel to
  prevent it from drying. Set rollers of pasta machine at their widest
  setting.  Flatten small piece of dough, dust with flour and fold in half.
  Run it through pasta machine. Repeat this step 5 to 8 times until dough is
  smooth and not sticky. Change notch of pasta machine to the next setting
  and run dough through once without folding. Keep changing setting and
  working pasta sheet through machine until pasta reaches desired thickness.
  A good thickness for general use is about 1/16 inch. Sprinkle dough with
  flour between rollings if it is sticky.
