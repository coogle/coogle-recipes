      <step>  I was just mixing this up for a party I'm having on Sunday and thought you
  all would enjoy the recipe. This is soooooo good and simple. I always hope
  to have leftovers and I end up eating it for lunch (or even dinner) the
  next day. It comes from the Mr. Food Cookbook - OH, It's So Good -
  
  Cut a hole in the top of the bread loaf about 5 inches in diameter. Remove
  soft bread from cut portion and discard. Reserve crust to make top for
  loaf. Scoop out most of the soft inside portion of the loaf and save for
  other purposes, such as stuffing or dried bread crumbs. In the butter,
  saute the green onions and the garlic until the onions wilt. Cut the cream
  cheese into small chunks, add the onions, garlic, sour cream and cheddar
  cheese. Mix well. Fold in artrichoke hearts, Out all of this mixture into
  hollowed out bread. Place top on bread and wrap in a couble thickness of
  heavy duty aluminum foil. Bake in 350 degree oven for 1 1/2 hours. When
  ready, remove foil and serve, using cocktail rye bread to dip out the
  sauce.
