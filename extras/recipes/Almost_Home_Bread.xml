    <directions>
      <step>  Combine milk, water, and 1/3 c. margarine in a saucepan. Heat until liquids
  are very warm (120-130~). Margarine doesn't need to melt. Place 6 cups
  flour, sugar, salt and yeast in Bowl. Mix for about 1 minute, then
  gradually add eggs, then warm liquid. Mix until smooth. Add remaining flour
  until dough clings to dough hook (or becomes unmanageable for your mixer).
  Remove from bowl and knead for 10 minutes, or until dough is smooth and
  elastic. Place in greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover; let rise in
  warm place, free from draft, until doubled in bulk, about 35 minutes. (Know
  what I do? I put a towel on a rack in my oven and set the bowl there. And
  then I close the oven door and turn the oven on its lowest setting while
  counting to 20. Turn the oven off; this seems to provide the bread an
  optimal temperature for rising.) Meanwhile, combine 1/2 c. sugar and
  cinnamon. Punch dough down. Little by little, knead in those raisins until
  distributed evenly. Divide dough in half; roll each half to a 14x9"
  rectangle. Brush lightly with melted margarine. Sprinkle each with half
  cinnamon-sugar mixture. Beginning at the 9" end, tightly roll dough and
  shape into loaves. Place in 2 greased 9" loaf pans. Cover; let rise in warm
  place, free from draft, until doubled in bulk, about 35 minutes. Take the
  loaves AND the towel out of your oven (towel flambe just ain't that chic,
  folks). Place oven rack on lowest position. Loosely "tent" aluminum foil
  over top of each loaf. Preheat oven to 375~. Bake for about 40 minutes;
  remove foil "tents" and brush tops of loaves with margarine. Bake 5 minutes
  longer. Remove from pans and cool on wire racks.
  
  NOTE: Best to toast this in a toaster oven inasmuch as the cinnamon swirls
  tend to "separate" a bit. But this alters the taste not in the slightest!
  Millions (well LOTS) of palates have thrilled to this stuff. Yours will,
  too!
