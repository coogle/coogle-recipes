    <directions>
      <step>  Note: Make this a day ahead so you can skim off the
  fat. Preheat oven to 375øF.
  Cover both sides of brisket with lots of pepper. Over
  a medium flame, heat the oil in a heavy casserole or
  roasting dish and brown the brisket on all sides. Take
  the brisket out of the pan and set aside. Add the
  onions to the casserole and cook them over medium-high
  heat. As you stir them, scrape up the brown bits from
  the bottom of the casserole. cook the onions for about
  15 minutes, or until they are thoroughly browned. Add
  the carrots, garlic, and bay leaves; stir for another
  1-2 minutes. Take the casserole off the burner and
  carefully put the brisket back into its nest of
  vegetables. Coat the brisket on both sides with tomato
  paste. Sprinkle more pepper, and a little salt, over
  the tomato paste. Pour the tomatoes and red wine into
  the bottom of the casserole. Cover the casserole
  tightly, first with a layer of foil and then with the
  lid. Let the pot roast cook on the middle rack of the
  oven for 3« hours. check the liquid level in the
  casserole frequently; if it gets too low, add a little
  water or beef broth. When the meat is tender, take it
  out of the oven. Keep the meat covered while you cool
  it to room temperature. Then put it in the
  refrigerator overnight. The next day, spoon off all
  the solidified fat you can. Discard the bay leaves.
  Bring the meat back to room temperature and reheat it
  ÄÄ along with its juices and the vegetables ÄÄ either
  on top of the stove or in the oven. When it's hot,
  slice it on the diagonal and serve with the pan juices
  and vegetables spooned over. Add salt at the table, if
  needed.
