      <step>  Apples are most bountiful during the fall, and there's no better way to
  impress your family or dinner guests than with a freshly baked Apple Tarte
  Tatin, a simple and elegant dessert created by two sisters from the Loire
  Valley who earned their living making what the French call "tarte des
  demoiselles Tatin, or "the tart of two unmarried women named Tatin." This
  famous French upside-down apple tart is made by covering the bottom of a
  shallow baking dish with butter and sugar, then a layer of apples and
  finally a pastry crust. while baking, the sugar and butter turn into a
  delicious caramel that becomes the topping when the tart is inverted onto a
  serving plate.
  
  Choose firm apples that won't soften while baking, like Northern Spy,
  Winesap or Granny Smith. You can save time and add richness to the tart by
  using a store-bought puff pastry, instead of making p‰te brisŽe or p‰te
  sucrŽe. Whichever pastry you use, make sure to keep it well-chilled. Martha
  Stewart likes to make this tart in a cast iron skillet because it helps the
  fruit to caramelize, but any heavy-duty nonstick pan with a heat-proof
  handle will do.
  
  Tarte Tatin can be made in advance and left in the pan; simply rewarm it on
  the stove over low heat to loosen the caramel, making it easy to remove
  from the pan. For a change, try making this dessert with peaches or pears,
  and don't forget to serve it with a dollop of freshly whipped cream, cr�me
  fra”che or vanilla ice cream. It's a dessert your family and friends will
  remember forever.
  
  1. Heat oven to 400¡. Core apples using a melon baller to retain the
  rounded shape of the apples. Rub apples with sliced lemons to prevent
  browning. Set aside.
  
  2. Over medium heat in a 10-inch cast iron skillet, heat sugar and water.
  Cook until it turns a rich golden color; swirling occasionally, about 6 to
  7 minutes. Meanwhile, roll puff pastry in one direction out into a 14-inch
  circle on a lightly floured surface, about 1/8-inch thick. Brush off any
  excess flour with a pastry brush.
  
  3. Add butter to skillet. Once melted, add the apples; rounded sides down.
  Adding as many as possible. Remove from heat and top apples with puff
  pastry. Fold edges under and crimp slightly. Make 2 to 3 small cuts in the
  puff pastry to allow the steam to escape. Place in oven for 10 minutes.
  Reduce heat to 375¡ and bake until pastry isgolden brown, about 20 to 25
  minutes.
  
  4. Remove from oven and Loosen edges with a knife. Carefully place a plate
  over the skillet and flip, inverting the Tarte Tatin. Serve warm or at room
  temperature.
