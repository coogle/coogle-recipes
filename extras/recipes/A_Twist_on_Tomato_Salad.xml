      <step>  When tomatoes are at their peak, slice them and arrange on a platter. Make
  a dressing from one part fruit or white-wine vinegar and three parts good
  olive oil. Stir in the Adobo de Achiote a bit at a time until everything is
  beautifully oarange and the achiote is necely detectable; you may need to
  season the dressing with more salt. Drizzle over the tometoes, then
  sprinkle with thinly sliced green onions or sliced green-tops-on-white
  onion. Strew with chopped herbs (anything from cilantro to chervil will be
  welcom), and you're ready to serve
