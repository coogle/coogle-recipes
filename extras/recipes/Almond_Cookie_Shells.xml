      <step>       Put the egg whites in a bowl and beat them briefly.
  
       Add the sugar and flour, then whisk.  Stir in the almonds.
  
       Butter a sheet pan and spoon tablespoons of mixture onto the pan.
  Spread the spoonfuls on the sheet slightly with the back of a spoon to
  form circles about 2 inches apart.
  
       Bake in a 350 F oven for 5 - 7 minutes.  Remove from oven and while
  still hot, you can mold the cookies into small cups by placing them over
  small cups, or shot glasses, or even the back of a muffin tin.   Set aside
  to dry.
  
       When dry, the almond cookies can be eaten as is, or in my favorite
  way which is to fill them with mousse of some kind - or even ice cream or
  yogurt (if you eat hurriedly before they soften.)  ;-)
