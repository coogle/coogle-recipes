      <step>  Place liquid, butter, salt and sugar, if using, in a medium saucepan and
  bring slowly to a simmer. Turn off heat and add the flour all at once. Stir
  vigorously with a wooden spoon until it forms a ball. Return to medium heat
  to dry the paste so it will have the maximum puffing ability: turn the ball
  around in the pan, pressing it against the sides and flipping it over,
  until butter starts oozing out and the paste no longer sticks to your
  fingers. Remove from heat and let cool a bit. Turn the paste into a medium
  bowl or the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle and beat in the
  eggs, one at a time, with a wooden spoon or the paddle. Each time you add
  an egg, the mixture will become slippery and messy but will then come
  together, at which point you can add the next egg. Load mixture into pastry
  bag with a round tip (1/2 or 1-inch depending on size puff desired) and
  pipe out as required. It will give the fullest puff if used right away but
  can be held for several hours. Basic proportions for Pate a Choux are
  1:1:1:1/2, or 1 cup liquid, 1 cup flour:1 cup egg:1/2 cup butter. Water
  makes choux more crisp, milk makes them more tender, Puffs expand when
  cooked as water in batter turns to steam and explodes the dough. Pate a
  choux is an extremely versatile pastry that can be the base of many sweet
  and savory dishes. It can take many forms: be poached as gnocchi, baked to
  form hollow puffy balls that can be filled with various things, or fried as
  fritters and sprinkled with sugar. It is neutral in flavor so is adaptable
  to any cuisine. Copyright, 1996, TV FOOD NETWORK, G.P., All Rights Reserved
