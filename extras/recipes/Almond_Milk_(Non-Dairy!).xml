      <step>  Use raw almonds. Place almonds in blender and grind to fine powder. Add
  syrup and 1 c water.  Blend 1-2 minutes until smooth. With blender running
  on high, slowly add remaining water. Blend 2 minutes. Place strainer over
  large bowl.  Line with cheesecloth (not 100% neccessary, but recommended.
  Otherwise strain twice with very fine strainer.) Pour almond milk slowly
  into strainer and let filter through. When all milk has passed through
  strainer, press remaining milk out of accumulated almond fiber. Each
  serving will be approximately 1-1/4 cups. Milk will keep in fridge 4-5
  days.  Leftover fiber can be used as moisturizing body scrub in the shower.
