      <step>  Funny you should ask about juicing. I just got my juicer out last week and
  decided to use it. I went to the library and checked out a book named
  "Juicing for Life" by Cherie Calbom and Maureen Keane. It is a guide to the
  health benefits of fresh fruits and vegetable juicing. It has alot of
  recipes for juice combinations. I have been using it for about a week. I
  think I'm going to like it. Here are a couple of recipes to get you started
  but you should go check it out.
