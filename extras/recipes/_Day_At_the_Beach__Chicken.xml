      <step>  (from the Kitchen of Doom)
  
  Mix the dressing and the Dale's, and let the mix chill in the fridge while
  you skin the chicken breasts. (My bow to the Fat Police-) Rub the chicken
  with seasoned salt, pepper, and the Roasting mix to taste. When that's
  done, put the chicken and the dressing mix in a bowl, and marinade for at
  least an hour.
  
  Turn the oven on at 350. Arrange the chicken breasts, meat side up, in a
  pan, and pour the marinade over them. Sprinkle with a little cinnamon. Let
  them cook until nearly done, basting often. Increase the oven temp to 400
  for the last few minutes of cooking time.
  
  The chicken should have a nice, dark red color when it comes out of the
  oven. And it smells wonderful while it's cooking. Be sure you baste it
  fairly often, though. I have a feeling that it would try to dry out if you
  gave it the chance.
  
  I served my red chicken with nibblets, pineapples, and baked potatoes. If
  you don't have Dale's Sauce around (it's a regional thing, I think-) you
  can sub dark soy sauce with a little worchestershire in it and get basicly
  the same taste and effect. The Spice Hunter's rub is a spicy mix of things
  like curry and cumin. Use it sparingly.
