      <step>  Christmas in Spain is a vast festival that combines the religious spirit of
  the Nativity with the delights of the table. In village markets and urban
  areas throughout Spain, each holiday specialty recipe is carefully prepared
  for holiday feasting and gift-giving.
  
  Extraordinary dulces (sweets) including sugared-fruits, cream-filled cakes
  and pastries oozing with jam, fill shops and tearooms everywhere. Just in
  case you aren't making a trip to Spain for the holidays, try preparing this
  almond-puff cookie tonight and you'll get a taste of Spanish holiday baking
  courtesy of The Cook &amp; Kitchen Staff at Recipe-a-Day.com.
  
  Pre-heat over to 325-F degrees. Lightly toast the almonds and set aside to
  cool when complete. Beat egg whites until stiff, but not dry. Gradually add
  sugar, beating constantly. After the confectioners’ sugar has been added,
  beat 5 to 8-minutes longer. Fold in almonds and vanilla. Place by spoonfuls
  or shape into rings on a greased cookie sheet. Bake for 17 to 20-minutes or
  until cookies just begin to color. Removed from cookie sheet to cool. Serve
  or store in an airtight container.
  Happy Cooking from The Cook &amp; Kitchen Staff at http://www.recipe-a-day.com
