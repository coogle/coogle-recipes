  "Allt om Mat" is a leading Swedish food magazine. We were immensely proud
  when it published our recipe for Anna cutlets in the early 1970s. (We also
  appreciated when the magazine, 25 years later, included a link to our
  recipe collection - see AoM #17, 1997.) It is a very convenient dish, can
  be prepared long in advance with everything contained in one pot.
  
  1.Fry the mushroom slices briefly in a hot frying-pan.
  
  2.Place the pork cuts in a buttered gratin dish and cover them with the
  mushrooms, then put the potato slices on top in a even layer.
  
  3.Use salt and pepper as desired, then top with very thin slices of butter.
  
  4.Cook in the oven at 200 - 225 oC for 45 minutes.
  Serve together with a tomato-lettuce-cucumber salad.
