    <directions>
      <step>  Place instant potatoes in a small bowl, add the scalded milk, and stir to
  dissolve. In another bowl, mash the yeast and add water and sugar. Stir
  well and set aside.
  
  In a large mixer bowl, combine flour, sugar, and salt Add the potato
  mixture, yeast mixture, and butter. Stir with a spatula until flour is
  moistened. Using a mixer dough hook, knead mixture for 10 minutes. It
  should form a ball and pull away from the bottom of the container. Place
  dough in a fresh, buttered bowl. Cover lightly and let rise in a warm place
  until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
  
  Thinly butter two 8 x 4-inch loaf pans. Add a small amount of the cornmeal
  to the pans and rotate to evenly coat the interiors. Knock out any excess.
  Set aside.
  
  Punch down and divide dough into 2 equal pieces. On a sparingly floured
  board, roll out one piece of dough into an 8 x 14-inch rectangle. Brush off
  any excess flour, then roll into a loaf shape, pinching bottom seam to
  seal. Place dough, seam side down, in prepared pan. Repeat with remaining
  dough. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until dough
  extends 2 inches above pan.
  
  Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375F degrees.
  
  Bakes loaves in the oven for 34 to 40 minutes or until golden brown. Loaves
  should make a hollow sound when tapped. Let cool on a wire rack.
  
  Makes 2 loaves
