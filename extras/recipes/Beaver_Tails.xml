      <step>  This tid-bit of the old time trappers will be tasted by few of the younger
  generation. Broil the beaver tail over hot coals for a few minutes (or in
  one of those new electric ovens). The rough scaly hide will blister and
  come off, leaving the tail clean, white and solid. Then roast or boil until
  tender. This is considered very strengthening food (use only young beaver).
  For a special treat, cool, souse in vinegar, add raw onion rings, salt and
  pepper to taste.
