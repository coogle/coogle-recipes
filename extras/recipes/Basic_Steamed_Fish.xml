    <directions>
      <step>  1. Have fish cleaned and scaled, but left whole. Rinse in cold water. Dry
  well with paper toweling; then rub lightly with salt, inside and out. Place
  in a shallow heatproof dish. (If fish is too large, cut it in two.)
  
  2. Prepare any of the topping mixtures (see "Steamed Fish Topping
  Mixtures") and spread over fish.
  
  3. Steam until done (see "How-to Section"). (Allow about 30 minutes for a
  2-1/2 pound fish; 20 minutes for a 1-1/2 pound fish; 15 minutes for a
  3/4-inch thick fish steak; and 7 to 10 minutes for a thinly sliced or
  flatfish.)
  
  4. Garnish fish with shredded scallions and Chinese parsley. Serve
  immediately. VARIATIONS:
  
  1. In step 3, during the last 10 minutes of steaming, top whole fish with
  several clams in their shells (scrub them clean first). The shells will
  open when steamed.
  
  2. In step 3, steam 2 cakes of bean curd, sliced or cubed, with the fish.
  
  3. Steam the fish, topped only with 1/2 teaspoon salt, 2 slices fresh
  ginger root and 1 scallion, both shredded. Then heat 1/4 cup peanut oil to
  smoking and pour over fish. Sprinkle immediately with 3 tablespoons soy
  sauce and serve at once, garnished with shredded scallion.
  
  4. Steam the fish, topped with a mixture of 2 tablespoons sherry, 1/2
  teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon ginger juice. Then serve with a Five Willow or
  sweet-and-pungent sauce poured over (see "Sweet-and-Pungent Sauce"
  recipes).
