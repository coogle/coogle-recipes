      <step>  Combine the flour and egg in the mixing bowl of a food processor fitted
  with a steel blade.Process for a few minutes.The dough will look very
  granular,like yellow-colored,uncooked cream of wheat.Pinch the dough.It
  should stock together.If it does not stick,mix in a bit of oil or water.
  Form a ball with the dough and knead for a few minutes on a lightly floured
  board.It will become smooth and hard(much harder than bread dough).In a few
  minutes,the dough should look satiny and smooth.Wrap it in plastic and let
  rest for about 30 minutes. Then roll out the dough through a pasta roller
  or by hand.Sprinkle additional flour on the dough as needed to prevent
  sticking.The dough is quite forgiving and can be handled easily. When the
  rolled-out pasta sheet feels dry,not sticky,cut into noodles by hand or
  with the machine. If you have a pasta drying rack,hang the cut pasta on the
  rack.If not,wrap the noodles around your hand to form a nest and set it on
  a lightly floured board.Toss with flour on occasion to allow the pasta to
  dry evenly. Fresh pasta cooks quickly.Add it to boiling water and test a
  strand every 15 seconds until done. Sometimes,I vary this recipe by adding
  1 1/2 tsp. of olive oil and up to 1 tbsp. of a flavoring ingredient,such as
  minced fresh herbs or garlic,tomato paste or pureed beets. Keeping the same
  proportions of 1 egg to 3/4 cup flour,the recipe can be multiplied as many
  times as needed.A 1 egg recipe will feed 1 or 2 people for a main course;a
  2 egg recipe feeds 2 to 3.An average size food processor will handle a 3
  egg recipe easily.If you need to make more,it is a good idea to make
  several batches.
