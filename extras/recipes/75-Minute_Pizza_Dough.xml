      <step>  Sometimes you don't have the time to let pizza dough rise at night, nor do
  you have the forethought to use the slow-rise process and start the dough
  rising in the morning (using only a fraction of the ordinary amount of
  yeast). For those occasions, try this especially fast recipe. By using
  rapid-rise yeast, a warm oven, warm water, and a little sugar, you can make
  a dough that will rise in only forty minutes. This means the entire
  
  process of making a pizza can be done in about seventy-five minutes from
  
  start to finish. Since convenience is the watchword here, all-purpose flour
  is used instead of bread flour. Although it does not have quite the
  tenderness or full flavor of dough made using the Master Recipe for Pizza
  Dough, this dough makes a very good pizza in very little time.
  
  1. Set oven to 200 degrees for 10 minutes, then turn oven off.
  
  2. Meanwhile, in bowl of food processor fifted with either metal or plastic
  blade, add water and sprinkle in yeast and sugar. Pulse twice to
  
  dissolve yeast. Add all remaining ingredients and process until mixture
  forms cohesive mass. Dough should not be sticky (if it is, add 2 more
  tablespoons flour and pulse briefly) nor should it be dry and crumbly (if
  it is, add 1 more tablespoon water and pulse briefly). Let rest for 2
  minutes. Process for another 30seconds.
  
  3. Remove dough from food processor and knead by hand on floured work
  surface for 1 minute or until dough is smooth and satiny (dough will feel a
  bit tough at this point).
  
  4. Very lightly oil large bowl with vegetable oil. Place dough in bowl (do
  not coat dough with oil) and cover with plastic wrap.Place in warm oven.
  
  Let rise for 40 minutes or until doubled.Remove from oven, punch down,
  remove from bowl, and separate into two round pieces. Let rest for 10
  minutes under a damp dish towel, then shape, top, and bake in preheated
  500-degree oven according to the following chart. Cook pizza an additional
  2-3 minutes after adding cheese, or until cheese is completely melted.
