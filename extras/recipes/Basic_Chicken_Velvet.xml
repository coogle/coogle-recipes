      <step>  Chicken Velvet, known also as Chicken Essence, is an elegant and festive
  dish. It calls for chicken breast (skinned, boned and minced to a pulp) to
  be combined with egg whites and then either sauteed in oil or poached
  briefly in a rich concentrated stock. The basic preparation includes the
  following steps:
  
  1. Skin and bone the chicken breast; then pound flat with a mallet or the
  side of a cleaver.
  
  2. Cut the meat in 1-inch cubes; then mince or grind in any of the
  following ways:
  
   a. Mince on a hardwood cutting board, removing tendons.
  
   b. Grind in a mortar and pestle. Remove tendons.
  
   c. Blend at low speed in a blender, turning the motor on and off. Remove
  and discard gristle that attaches to blades.
  
   d. Run twice through a hand grinder (set at the finest setting). Remove
  gristle.
  
  3. During the mincing or grinding above, add about 1 tablespoon of water, a
  drop at a time, to give the mixture a paste-like consistency. (Sherry may
  be used in place of water.)
  
  4. Beat the egg whites until fluffy, but not stiff and dry; then fold into
  chicken mixture.
