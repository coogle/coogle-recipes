      <step>  * - frozen white or whole wheat, thawed
  
  Set loaves on a floured board and pat each loaf into a 5x10" rectangle.
  Cover lightly with plastic wrap and let rinse until puffy, 45 minutes to 1
  hour.
  
  Cut each loaf crosswise into 9 equal pieces. Pick up the ends of each
  piece, and stretch it to the length of a 12x15" greased baking sheet and
  set on pan; if dough snaps back, let rest a few minutes, then stretch
  again. Repeat to make each stick, spacing about 1 1/2" apart.
  
  With scissors at a 45' angle, snip dough to make cuts about 1/2" apart
  along about 4" of 1 end of each stick.
  
  Beat egg white until slightly frothy; brush dough lightly with egg white.
  Mix cheese, tarragon, and dill. Sprinkle evenly over dough.
  
  Bake in a 350' oven until breadsticks are browned, 20-25 minutes. (If using
  1 oven, switch pan positions halfway through baking; chill remaining pans
  of dough until oven is free.) Transfer breadsticks to racks.
  
  Serve warm or cool. If you make sticks ahead, let cool, package airtight,
  and hold up to 4 hours, or freeze. To recrisp, bake breadsticks (thawed, if
  frozen), uncovered, on pans in a 350' oven until warm, about 5 minutes.
