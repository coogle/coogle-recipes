    <directions>
      <step>  Fry bacon until almost done (it will cook a bit more in the oven). Drain on
  paper towel. Cook the ground beef until it is no longer pink - drain.
  Saute' the onion in a small amount of oil until it is soft.
  
  Bake your favorite pizza crust at 425 degrees for 5 - 10 minutes just until
  it begins to brown. Remove from oven and spread with mustard. Top with
  ground beef and onion and return to oven for another 5 - 10 minutes until
  crust edges are lightly browned. Add the bacon, pickles and cheese and
  return to the oven until the cheese has melted. Remove from the oven and
  enjoy.
  
  Note: If you don't like warm pickles, you can add them just before servng.
