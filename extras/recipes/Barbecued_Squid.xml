  Bangkok and it was one of the best meals I had there.
  
  This recipe sounds too easy to be true.  It isn't.  As with any
  grilled seafood, the fresher the ingredients and the simpler the
  cooking, the better the end result.  Barbecued squid and an anise
  flavored aperitif like Pernod, ricard, ouzo or raki, make a wonderful
  combination. Make a fire, preferably with firewood or Mexican
  charcoal, started from paper and kindling.  Skewer the squid.  When
  coals are red hot, barbecue the rings for 2 to 3 minutes per side, or
  until they are brown.
  
  Some recipes for grilled squid suggest marinating them.  I omit this
  procedure because it adds flavor at the expense of softening the
  flesh. Serve hot with lemon-garlic butter.
  
  NOTE:  Commercial charcoal and lighter fluid are petroleum products.
  They impart an oily flavor to food.  Hardwood, or Mexican charcoal, a
  commercial product, which is made by burning down mesquite, both give
  a nice flavor and are certainly less toxic than petrochemicals.
  Mexican charcoal is available in Northern California through Lazzari
  Fuel Company, San Francisco.
