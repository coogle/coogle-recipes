      <step>  Makes 1 large loaf
  
  Dissolve yeast in the warm water in large mixing bowl. Blend in the ginger
  and 1 Tbsp of the honey.  Let stand in a warm place until the mixture is
  bubbly (about 15 minutes). Stir in the remaining honey, and the milk, salt,
  and oil.  With mixer on low speed (or with a wooden spoon) beat in the
  flour 1 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. If you are using
  amixer, beat in the last cup of flour with a wooden spoon. The dough should
  be heavy but too sticky to knead.
  
  Place dough in a 2-pound, WELL-GREASED coffee can. Cover with greased
  plastic lid.  At this point, you may freeze the dough if you want to and
  bake it at a later time.
  
  To bake, let stand, covered in a warm place until the dough rises and pops
  off the lid.  This will take 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Discard the lid and bake at
  350 F for 1 hour. The crust will be very brown. Brush the top lightly with
  butter.
  
  Let the entire bread and can cool for 5 to 10 minutes on a wire rack, then
  loosen the crust around the edge of the can with a thin knife and slide the
  bread from the can. Cool it in an upright position on the wire rack.
  
  VARIATION:  Add to the yeast mixture 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.
  With the final addition of flour, add 1/2 cup raisins and 1/2 cup chopped
  walnuts.
