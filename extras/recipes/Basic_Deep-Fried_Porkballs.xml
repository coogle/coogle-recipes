      <step>     1. Mince or grind pork and ginger root.
  
     2. Blend cornstarch and cold water to a paste, then stir in salt and soy
  sauce. Add to pork and ginger and mix well. Form into walnut-size balls,
  but do not overhandle or pack too tightly. Meanwhile heat oil.
  
     3. Add porkballs one at a time, and deep-fry several at once, turning
  frequently for even cooking. When porkballs float, remove from pan and let
  cool slightly.
  
     4. Reheat oil. Return porkballs to fry 1 minute more. (Cut one open to
  make sure meat is no longer pink.) Drain on paper toweling.
  
     5. Serve with a sweet-and-pungent sauce poured over, or with a
  pepper-salt mix (see recipe "Basic Pepper-Salt Mix"). Or serve as an hors
  d'oeuvre on a bed of lettuce strips.
  
     NOTE: Use pork that has some fat. When using cuts such as shoulder or
  butt, remove skin before mincing.
  
     VARIATIONS: For the minced ginger, substitute 1 teaspoon ginger juice.
  
     In step 2, add to meat mixture 1/2 teaspoon curry powder; or add any or
  all of the following:
  
        1    egg, beaten
  
  :       1 scallion stalk or small onion, minced
  
        1    garlic clove, minced
  
        1    teaspoon sugar
  
        1    tablespoon sherry
  
  :       1/4 cup dried black mushrooms (soaked), minced
  
  :       1/4 cup water chestnuts, minced; or celery, chopped
  
  :       few drops of sesame oil
  
     In step 3, before deep-frying, dredge porkballs lightly in cornstarch;
  or dredge in cornstarch and dip in beaten egg.
