    <directions>
      <step>  Finely chop the walnuts and the garlic in a food processor; add half the
  basil and the salt; coarsely chop. Add the remaining basil and the parsley.
  With the food processor running, add the oil in a slow steady stream
  through the feed tube until mixture is thoroughly blended. Transfer to a
  bowl; fold in the cheese. Remove 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking liquid before
  draining the pasta. Toss hot pasta with the sauce and the reserved cooking
  liquid. Serve at once with additional cheese, if desired.
  
  Note: taste and adjust salt and add pepper) I grow basil in a very large
  pot during the spring and summer and make a lot of batches of pesto
  (omitting the cheese) and freeze individually in small Dixie cups. After it
  is frozen, I remove from the cups and wrap in Saran Wrap, then place in a
  freezer Ziploc. To serve defrost as many "pesto patties" as you need and
  follow above directions remembering to save the pasta water and add cheese.
  I also use 4 cloves of garlic in this recipe (we love garlic) and add more
  salt and pepper.
