      <step>  Preheat the oven to 350F.
  
  To prevent the filo drying out, cover it first with a sheet of greaseproof
  paper then with a tea-towel wrung out in cold water. Brush a 13x10 inch
  baking dish with a little of the butter. Brush half the sheets of filo
  pastry with butter and lay in the bking dish, one on top of the other.
  Spread over the filling ingredients, then cover with the remaining pastry
  sheets, again buttering each one before laying it down.
  
  Using a sharp knife, tuck the edges down neatly round the sides. Brush with
  the remaining butter. Using a sharp knife, cut into diamonds. Bake in the
  over for 25 minutes, then reduce the heat to 300F and bake for a further 30
  minutes.
  
  While the Baklava is cooking, put the sugar for the syrup into a pan with
  10 fluid ounces water and the lemon juice. Stir over a medium heat until
  the sugar has dissolved. Bring to the boil and simmer for 5 minutes. Cool.
  As soon as the Baklava comes ut of the oven, pour over the syrup, then
  leave to cool completely.
