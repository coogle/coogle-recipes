    <directions>
      <step>  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Into large bowl, combine crackers, drained
  oysters, melted butter and black pepper to taste. Stir gently till well
  mixed. Add evaporated milk to reserved oyster liquid to make 2 cups. Pour
  into cracker-oyster mixture, stir gently to mix well. Spoon mixture into
  greased casserole dish ( I use my deep "French White" Pyrex casserole
  dish). Pour enough milk over mixture to make it "soupy". Milk should be to
  top of mixture. Bake at 350 degrees for 30-40 minutes until "puffed" and
  lightly browned.
  
  (This dish is better too moist than it is too dry. It has taken me several
  attempts to get this right because I thought I was adding too much milk to
  it. It was always turning out too dry until I let go of my fear of making
  it too "soupy". I hardly ever get it to turn out exactly the same every
  time, but at least it's not too dry anymore!!!)
  
  Notes: It just isn't Thanksgiving or Christmas w/o Mom's Baked Oysters!!
  This is my absolute favorite holiday dish. I AM thinking of modifying it
  the next time by adding about 1/2 cup of thinly sliced, celery.
