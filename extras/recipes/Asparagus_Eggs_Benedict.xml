      <step>  Fill a medium saucepan or wide deep skillet 3/4 full with hot tap water.
  Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to maintain a gentle boil. Trim
  off and discard woody ends of asparagus. Place asparagus in shallow
  microwave-safe casserole dish, cover with vented plastic wrap, and cook at
  HIGH power 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 minutes or until asparagus are crisp-tender.
  Cover tightly; set aside in a warm place. Break whole eggs, one at a time,
  into a small dish. Slip eggs into simmering water. Cook about 3 minutes for
  soft-set eggs or until cooked as desired. While eggs are cooking, place egg
  yolks in blender container. Add lemon juice, salt and cayenne pepper. Place
  butter in microwave-safe measuring cup and cook at HIGH power until melted
  and bubbly, about 1 to 1-1/2 minutes. With blender running, pour hot butter
  in a stream through the hole in the lid. Blend 30 seconds or until sauce
  has thickened. Split and toast English muffins. Place 3 asparagus spears
  over each muffin half. Using a slotted spoon, place poached eggs over
  asparagus. Spoon sauce over eggs. Serving suggestion: Serve with a fresh
  fruit salad or melon wedges. Makes 2 servings. SOURCE: "In Season," a
