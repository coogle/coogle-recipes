      <step>  Recipe adapted from Sameen Rushdie's `Indian Cookery' Serves 6 as part of a
  mixed meal, maybe 3-4 on its own with rice/naan and a pickle. This works
  well with either fresh or frozen spinach. I have made it with kale as well;
  10oz (275g) weighed without stalks.
  
  1. Scrub potatoes and boil them in their skins until almost, but not quite,
  done. Leave to cool, then cut into small cubes.
  
  2. Meanwhile, if using fresh spinach or kale, remove the coarse stalks then
  rinse and cook gently for 10 minutes, in just the water clinging to the
  leaves in a covered pan. Cool and chop (reserve any remaining liquid). For
  frozen spinach, just defrost and chop.
  
  3. Chop the onion finely, crush or finely chop the garlic and finely chop
  the tomatoes (keep them all separate). Measure the spices out into a little
  bowl.
  
  4. Now brown the onion in a little vegetable stock or water until golden
  brown - about 10 minutes perhaps, topping up with hot water as necessary.
  Let it stick slightly from time to time to get that fried smell.
  
  5. Add the ginger and garlic to the pan and stir for a moment. Add the
  spices, and a little more water if necessary. Cook for a few minutes, then
  add the tomato. Cook gently 3-5 minutes.
  
  6. Add the potatoes and spinach, mix well then cover and simmer gently
  until ready, stirring once or twice to prevent sticking. It's done whenever
  the potatoes are cooked to your liking and the spices have permeated the
  vegetables.
