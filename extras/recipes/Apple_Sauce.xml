      <step>  Put all in a large pot and simmer, stirring often.  Check to maintain
  liquid level the first 10 minutes, and add water, if necessary, only to
  avoid scorching. Apples will start to add juice until, when they are cooked
  and mushy (about 20 minutes for a large pot). liquid will have reached top
  of apples. Sieve (old-fashioned type with a crank-type handle) in batches,
  and serve immediately (hot). My fiance was resistant to trying apple sauce
  with cinnamon, and had never had it hot, but when he had a taste, he went
  back for seconds and thirds!
  
  A word about the apples.  I prefer Granny Smiths.  These are tart, crisp,
  green apples that hold up well with cooking.  My second favorite is
  McIntosh.  Bought in large bags or bulk, this can be a very reasonable
  treat this time of year in northeast USA.
