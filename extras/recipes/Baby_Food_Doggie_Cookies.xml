      <step>  Combine ingredients in bowl and mix well. Roll into small balls and place
  on well-greased cookie sheet. Flatten slightly with a fork. Bake in
  preheated 350 degree oven for 15 minutes until brown. Cool on wire racks
  and STORE IN REFRIGERATOR.  Also freezes well. Another Prodigy member made
  these substituing cream of wheat for wheat germ and then used tablespoon to
  make cookie sized drops on plate. Microwaved for 4 minutes on Medium High.
  Suggested keeping an eye on them in microwave and perhaps start out for
  only 3 1/2 minutes. They do come out soft. Also suggested using
  Beef/Vegetable Dinner Baby Dinner insted of Beef or Chicken. This recipe
  was originally posted on *P.
