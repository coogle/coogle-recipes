      <step>   1. Heat salt and peppercorns in a dry skillet oyer medium-low heat. Stir
  or shake the pan constantly until the salt begins to brown and the odor of
  pepper is released (about 5 minutes).

  rolling pin; then strain through a sieve.
  
   3. Store mixture in a tightly capped jar. Use as a table condiment or dip
  for deep-fried and roasted foods.
  
   NOTE: These mixtures are also known as Fried Salt or Cantonese Salt.
  
   VARIATION: For the peppercoms, substitute either 1 teaspoon ground black
  or white pepper; or 2/3 teaspoon Chinese red pepper.
