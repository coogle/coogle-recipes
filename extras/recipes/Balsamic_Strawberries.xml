      <step>  This is an exquisite dish created by the talented Mollie Katzen. She
  advises the use of perfectlyRipe berries to maximize the effects of this
  traditional Italian treat. Please note that the berries may be sliced and
  sugared up to a day in advance. However the vinegar should be applied
  within
       30    minutes of serving.
  
  1. Clean the strawberries by wiping them with a damp paper towel. Avoid
  washing them directly in water as this dilutes the flavor of the berries by
  ab- sorbtion. 2. Hull the strawberries, and halve or slice them. This would
  depend on their size. Place the berries on a shallow pan (10-inch pie pan)
  and sprinkle with sugar. 3. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and allow to
  sit for several hours, shaking the pan every so often. If you plan you plan
  on letting then sit for more than 3 1/2 hours, they will have to
  beRefrigerated. 4. Sprinkle with vinegar within a half hour of serving
  atRoom temperature.
