    <directions>
      <step>  In bowl, combine hot water, butter, sugar and salt. stir until butter melts
  and let cool to warm. Stir in yeast and cover and let yeast get bubbly,
  about 15 minutes. Add 5 cups flour and beat with heavy duty mixer or wooden
  spoon to form a thick batter. With spoon, stir in enough remaining flour (
  3 1/2 cup ) to form a stiff dough.. turn out to floured board and knead
  smooth and elastic about 10 minutes. Turn dough over in a greased bowl and
  cover and let rise double in a warm place. ( 1 1/2 hrs ) . Punch down and
  form into a smooth ball.
  
  Cut a circle of foil to cover bottom of dutch oven. grease insides of dutch
  oven and underside of lid with salad oil. Place dough in pot and cover with
  lid. Let dough rise in a warm place until dough pushed up lid about 1/2
  inch.( about 1 hour but watch closely ). Bake covered with lid, in 375 oven
  for 12 minutes. Remove lid and bake 30 to 35 minutes or until loaf is
  golden brown and sounds hollow. Remove from oven and turn out onto rack (
  you may need a helper ) makes 1 very large delicious soft white bread.
  
  If you can wait till its warm, use a long bread knife to cut this delicious
  bread.                    Enjoy!               Joan Joan,"Flour Power"
