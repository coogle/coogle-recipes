      <step>  Mix the 1 cup sugar and 1 cup walnuts, set aside. Butter 9"x13" pan with
  pastry brush. Unwrap thawed fillo dough. Take first layer and fold in half,
  place in pan. Butter this layer with melted butter using pastry brush.
  Continue folding each layer and buttering each one until you get to about
  12-13. Take your sugar and nuts and pour evenly on top. Continue using the
  rest of the sheets of dough one at a time, folding, and buttering. When
  your finished with all the dough, take a sharp knife and cut diamond shape
  on top and all the way through. Sometimes the very top layer of dough will
  move around, just put it back with your fingers. When done cutting, pour
  remaining melted butter all over the top. Bake in 325 degrees oven for 1
  1/2 hours. As soon as you put the Baklava in the oven make your syrup. It;s
  important to make it now because you want the syrup to be completely cooled
  before pouring it on or the flaky dough will be mush. So boil the 2 cup
  sugar and 1 cup water until its bubbly and clear. Then add 1/2 tsp. lemon
  juice. When the HOT Baklava is done pour the cool syrup in the cracks and
  around the edges and a little on top. ENJOY!!
