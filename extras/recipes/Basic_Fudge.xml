      <step>  Notes: Before you begin, be sure to fill sink half full of cold water.
  Also, butter a dinner plate (or similar dish) to the edge to pour the
  fudge on when it is done.
  
  In a deep, heavy bottomed pan (I use a pressure cooker pan), mix
  together sugar, cocoa and milk. Cook on high heat, stirring
  constantly to remove any lumps from cocoa and prevent burning, until
  mixture comes to a boil. Continue boiling, stirring occasionally,
  until mixture reaches soft ball stage (about 10-15 minutes) and turn
  off heat (if you have an electric stove, move pan off burner as it
  will overcook the fudge with the remaining heat on the burner). Add
  vanilla extract and butter.
  
  Place pan in sink of cold water to speed cooling; do not let the
  water come over the edge of the pan. Beat with spoon until fudge
  starts to thicken slightly, it will still have a glossy look to it.
  After it has cooled, remove pan from water (be sure and put a kitchen
  towel on your lap for protection as the pan will still be quite
  warm!) and continue to beat until the fudge loses its gloss and
  begins to get stiff. Add the pecans then. Beat a couple more minutes.
  Pour out onto buttered plate, scrape the sides and bottom to get as
  much on the plate as you can, let cool (if you can wait at least 10
  minutes), and it is ready to serve.
  
  Notes: Test for soft ball stage by dropping a partial spoonful into a
  cup of cold water. When the mixture forms a `soft' ball, it is ready
  or you can use a candy thermometer (I never have mastered those
  things). If your fudge comes out runny or a bit soft, it was
  undercooked; if it is hard and grainy, it was overcooked. Mine turns
  out all ways and we eat it.
  
  This recipe is *not* fail proof and it takes a lot of practice and
  patience to get the hang of it, good luck and watch the waistline!
