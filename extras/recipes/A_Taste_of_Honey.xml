      <step>  honey. From the first light of civilization, this golden sweet liquid has
  been held in high regard by man as a food, medicine, trading commodity, and
  as a social and spiritual force.
  
  It is hard to imagine the work that goes into its production. The worker
  bee of a hive must literally work herself to death during her six-week life
  span. It takes 556 worker bees flying one and one-third the distance around
  the world, to produce one ounce of honey! And, the honeybee is essential
  because of her ability to pollinate crops. The value of this service to
  farmers outweighs the dollar value of the entire honey production.
  
  Most of us are familiar with honey in its liquid state, clear and
  shimmering. But it can be found in other forms too. Look for these:
  
  Liquid Honey - is extracted from the comb and strained. Freshly extracted
  honey may crystallize within a few weeks. When heat-treated to remain
  liquid, it should keep for several months at room temperature, and is best
  kept tightly covered.
  
  Creamed Honey - is made by seeding liquid honey with finely granulated
  honey and storing it under controlled conditions until completely
  granulated. Since it has a smooth, fine texture and spreads easily, it is
  becoming increasingly popular.
  
  Comb Honey - is natural honey sealed in wax that is made by the bees in the
  hive. It may be sold in sections in wooden frames or it may be cut in
  sections and each piece wrapped separately.
  
  Chunk Honey - is labeled as such. It is sold in a container and consists of
  pieces of comb honey as well as liquid.
  
  Pasteurized Honey - may be either liquid or creamed honey that has been
  heated or "pasteurized" to destroy the yeasts that might cause the honey to
  ferment. Pasteurization does not affect the quality of the honey and it
  will keep almost indefinitely. It is labeled "pasteurized".
  
  Honey is sold in various size containers from 8 ounces to 8 pounds. It is a
  more economical buy in large containers.
  
  Color and Flavor: Honey varies in color, flavor and aroma depending on the
  kind of flowers from which the bees have gathered the nectar. As a rule,
  the lighter the honey, the milder the flavor. Clover honey is white and
  mild, while buckwheat honey is dark and strong. Honey may be a blend of
  several flavors. The color classes are: white, golden, amber and dark. The
  color is stated on the label.
  
  Storing: Honey is best stored at room temperature in a dry place. High
  temperatures may cause honey to darken. Creamed honey will change in
  texture when stored in a hot room and in this case is best refrigerated.
  Honey when well sealed may be stored almost indefinitely in the freezer
  without any changes occuring in flavor or texture.
  
  Use in Cooking and Baking: Honey may be used in place of sugar in many
  recipes but the amount of liquid must be reduced. One cup of honey may
  replace one cup of sugar but the liquid should be cut by one quarter. In a
  plain cake recipe, honey may be substituted for one half the sugar. Some
  baked foods made with honey may brown more quickly than those made with
  sugar and the oven temperature should be slightly lowered.
  
  Darker honeys give a distinctive flavor to muffins, breads and bars.
  
  To liquify honey, place container over warm water.
  
  A cup of honey weighs 12 ounces.
  
  A pound of honey measures 1 1/3 cups.
  
  Here are a few suggestions in the use of honey:
  
  Honey Cinnamon Butter: Cream 1/4 cup butter and blend in 1/4 cup honey and
  1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Spread on hot toast.
  
  Honey Butter Sauce: Heat until blended, 3/4 cup honey and 3 tablespoons
  butter. Cool and add 1 teaspoon lemon juice and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla. Serve
  with pancakes or waffles.
  
  Honey Nut Sauce: Dissolve 1 tablespoon of instant coffee in 2 tablespoons
  boiling water. Combine with 1 cup liquid honey and 1/4 cup toasted almonds.
  Serve over ice cream.
