      <step>  again add salt at this point. [I swear.. I rarely ever cook with salt, but
  it is a must here]. On your first try don't get too heavy handed [even
  though there are tricks to fixing it if it is too salty].
  
  Cover the pot [completely] and simmer for 45 minutes. Turn off stove.
  Remove cover and allow to cool.
  
  Now if you want just a clear broth: Dump the contents of the pot through a
  strainer into another pot. I then press down on the chicken, greens and
  onions in the strainer to release some very tasty juices that are hiding. I
  then throw all the things in the strainer out.
  
  If you want chicken soup: Using a slotted spoon [don't use your hand as the
  oil in the pot is hotter than you can imagine - speaking of which be VERY
  careful when dumping the soup into the strainer. I have burned my hand on
  many an occasion!] and remove the carrots to a separate place. Take out the
  chicken as well. When you start to strain the soup you are going to have to
  pick out the pieces of celery.
  
  Cut the chicken into chunks, slice the carrots and add the celery. I keep
  this is a separate container from the soup in the fridge [people like to
  eat the onions and the greens as well.]
  
  Now you need to find containers to put the soup into. You want to use
  containers that do not have a very large mouth. The reason for this is that
  the fat will congeal and you need to remove it. If the opening is not too
  big then the fat will congeal in a thick piece and is easier to remove then
  if it is a very wide mouth container [do not use a container too small to
  be able to remove the fat].
  
  After pouring the broth into containers refrigerate. You will need to let
  the soup at least overnight [maybe longer] until all the fat has risen to
  the top and has formed a hard solid piece. Remove the fat and discard [or
  you can save it for some very yummy but unhealthy recipes I have - also if
  you plan to make balls the chicken soup fat is a must!].
  
  What *I* do at this point is pour the soup through a funnel into empty
  plastic EvianÂ® water bottles. Fill one inch from top and freeze. It seems
  to last forever and is just as good when defrosted [you can also nuke the
  frozen soup for ten minutes which will give you enough liquid for a couple
  of servings].
  
  And that my dear friend is how to make the BEST chicken soup. Now you need
  to decide what to do with it. Soup noodles satisfy me just fine [if you
  make extra - again keep this in a separate container from the soup]. You
  can make balls and other endless possibilities.
  
  NOTES : *SECRET NOTE: I always believed the most flavor in the soup came
  from the fat/skin on the chicken. Over the years I have learned that not to
  be the case! So, now what you do is strain the soup. Keep all chicken,
  bones, and feet. Return them to the pot and start a second batch of soup
  adding to the leftovers from the first batch. It is so good I promise
  everyone you serve it to will swear it is the best they ever had!!!
