      <step>  We tried a recipe for a cheese log off the back of a bottle of Ass Kickin
  Horseradish Hot Sauce. We devoured as much as possible on crackers last
  night. But I coudn't resist trying some on my toasted bagel for
  breakfast....mmmmm good. It would make an excellent snack for anyone
  contemplating a fourth of July party.
  
  Even though it calls for a specific hot sauce, I imagine other hot sauces
  could be used. The subtle horseradish flavor in this hot sauce did add a
  nice flavor to the cheese log though.
  
  In your food processor, blend cream cheese, cheddar cheese, hot sauce and
  1/2 chopped nuts, mix until smooth. Divide in half, place onto plastic wrap
  and roll into a log shape. Refrigerate. Before serving, remove log fom
  plastic wrap and roll into the remainder of the chopped nuts. Serve with
  your favorite crackers and top with more hot sauce for spicier snack!
  Curt and I didn't feel that it was all that spicy. However, Curt's oldest
  daughter (Kelly) gave it a try and thought it was too spicy for her. Kelly
  is 14 and just beginning on her quest for enjoying spicy foods. Posted to
