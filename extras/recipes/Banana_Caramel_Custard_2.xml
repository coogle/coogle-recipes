  Have ready 2 sets of pans, two larger, deeper pans (roasting pans) and two
  
  smaller pans (9 inches long, 3 inches wide and 3 inches deep for the flan,
  which
  
  will be baked by steaming (ba=F1o maria) by placing these pans with the
  custard mixture in them into the larger pans and filling these larger pans
  with hot water to ome up about 2/3 the depth of the sides of the smaller
  pans. Heat oven to 350 degrees F and place the larger pans with water in
  them in center of oven.
  Prepare the custard this way:
  
  Caramelize or melt 1 cup of the white granulated sugar in heavy sauce pans
  over medium heat for 5 minutes - be careful not to burn sugar, keep on
  tilting the pan to spread sugar. As soon as sugar has melted, pour 1/2 into
  each of the smaller ans in which the custard will be cooked. Tilt these
  pans to allow caramel to spread and cover bottoms of pans.
  In large mixing bowl, combine mashed bananas and 1-1/2 cups sugar and heat
  with electric mixer to blend and become smooth. Beat in eggs until well
  blended. lowly add the milk, vanilla and pinch of salt. Beat with electric
  mixer at low speed until just blended. Divide mixture between the two loaf
  pans with caramelized sugar on their bottoms.
  Carefully place smaller pans with custard mixture in them into larger pans
  with hot water in the oven. Bake for 1-1/2 hours or until custard is set
  but still soft in center.
  Remove pans from the oven and let pans with custard coal on wire racks.
  Place inside the ref before unmolding onto serving platter. Run knife
  around flan to loosen out sides, then place oval platter over custard pan
  and flip it over. The caramel will liquify furring overnight stay in the
  ref and the custard will fall easily onto the platter, with the caramel
  syrup over it.
