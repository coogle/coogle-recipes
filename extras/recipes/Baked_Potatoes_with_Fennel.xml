  Heat oven to 425 degrees. Lightly spray a 2 quart baking dish. Cut off the
  tops of the fennel but keep the feathery leaves for garnish. Cut fennel
  into thin slices. Put in prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with seasonings and
  toss with the oil. Cover tightly with aluminum foil and bake til almost
  tender. Add thinly sliced potatoes to the fennel, add more seasoning if
  desired. Cover and bake until potatoes are tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Serve
  hot or warm.
  
  Notes: I haven't made this yet, but I see no reason to cook in two steps.
  My experience with cooking potatoes in the oven suggests that they will
  take about the same time as the fennel. I will layer them, after tossing
  both in the oil and seasonings, then cook them together. I'll let you know
  when I do it.
