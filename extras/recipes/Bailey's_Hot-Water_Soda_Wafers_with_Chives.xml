      <step>  Preheat oven to 425F degrees.
  
  Place water, salt, and butter in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil.
  Meanwhile, toss baking soda and flour together. When water is boiling, add
  flour all at once, stimng constantly with a wooden spoon. Continue to stir
  over low heat for another minute, until the mixture is well combined and
  has formed a ball.
  
  Pull off walnut-size pieces of dough and quickly roll each into a ball.
  Flatten slightly and sprinkle with chives. Place on an ungreased cookie
  sheet and press with heel of the hand until very thin. Prick with a fork in
  several places. Continue until all dough is used.
  
  Bake for 15 minutes or until browned and crisp. Allow to cool slightly on a
  rack. Makes approximately 48 wafers

  Notes: Lee's Intro: These wafers tend to toughen up if allowed to sit
  around too long so they are best eaten shortly after baking.
