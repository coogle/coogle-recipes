      <step>  The description "Truffle style" means they are cooked as truffles would be
  (sliced paper thin and quickly fried with a little oil, salt and pepper).
  
  Prepare artichokes as directed in "Cleaning artichokes ~ Jewish Style". Cut
  in half lengthwise and keep in lemon water. "Heat 1/4 cup of oil in a large
  skillet. Drain 6 artichokes very well. Cut into very thin slivers directly
  into the hot oil and fry, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes. Add salt and
  pepper to taste and continue to fry until slices are golden brown and
  crisp. Transfer to a hot serving dish and keep warm. Repeat with the
  remaining oil and artichokes.
