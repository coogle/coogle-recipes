      <step>  This coming Monday (25 April 94) Australia and New Zealand commemorate
  their war dead on Anzac Day (Australian &amp; New Zealand Army Corps, which
  were among the first soldiers ashore in the battle at Gallipoli in 1915
  during World War I - a 9-month campaign with grievous losses).  This day
  has become our most important national day of remembrance.
  
  Scottish oatmeal biscuits were cooked at home during WWI and sent to the
  soldiers fighting overseas.  After the war, these oat-based biscuits were
  named Anzac Biscuits when they were made and sold as fund-raisers for
  returned soldiers.
  
  Method:
  
  Mix oats, flour, sugar and coconut. Melt syrup and margarine [butter!]
  together in a small saucepan. Mix soda with boiling water and add to the
  syrup and margarine mix. Add dry ingredients and mix thoroughly.
  
  Place globs (about 1 T each) of the mix onto greased trays, allowing room
  for spreading while cooking.
  
  Cook for about 30 minutes at 150 degrees Celsius [about 300 F] Cool
  completely on racks before storing any you might have left :-)
