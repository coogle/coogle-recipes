    <directions>
      <step>     Store chocolate tightly wrapped or covered in a cool, dry place or in
  the refrigerator.  If refrigerated, let it warm to room temperature before
  using.
     Occaionally, there may be a slight graying or "bloom" on chocolate. This
  does not alter the quality or flavor and when used in a recipe, the
  chocolate will regain its color.
