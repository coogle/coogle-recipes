    <directions>
      <step>  Combine yeast and warm water in 3-quart bowl. Let stand until some yeast
  clumps rise to surface. Gradually stir in flours. Mixture will be very
  thick. Cover with plastic.
  
  Let stand overnight in warm place. Sponge will double and become puffy. Use
  as directed in recipes. Makes enough for 2 baguettes, 16 rolls and 2
  focaccia loaves.
