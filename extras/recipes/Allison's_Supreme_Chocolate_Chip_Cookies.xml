      <step>  1. Preheat oven to 375 Â°. Grease cookie sheets.
  
  2. Cream together shortening, butter, sugars and eggs.
  
  3. Add the rest of the ingredients (in order) and mix well.
  
  4. Spoon a tablespoonful amount into hand, shape into a ball and place on
  greased cookie sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until golden. Cool on rack
  a few minutes before eating.
  
  *Note- I add less chips because I don't like a lot of chocolate chips. The
  cookie dough tastes so good you don't need a lot of chips.
  
  I always use butter because I think it makes a better cookie. I also use
  butter flavor crisco instead of plain shortening. (These are comfort food
  remember..no low fat lol). Sometimes if the dough feels a little sticky I
  add extra flour (not too much) until it's easier to roll in your hands. I
  bake them on the reverse side of the cookie sheets and it works very well
  to make a nice chewy cookie. Don't let them overcook, as soon as the edges
  start to look brown, even if the center isn't set, they will be fine once
  they are cooled. Leave them on the cookie sheet for a minute or two and
  then cool completely on wire racks. When I picked up this recipe the author
  had written that these cookies stay soft for a long time. I don't know how
  she ever figured that out because they have never lasted longer than two
  days around here! Everyone who tastes them wants the recipe!
