      <step>  Here is a recipe for Almond Paste from the book "Secrets of A Jewish Baker"
  by George Greenstein.  It is really a treasure trove of how to's. This is
  one recipe I have yet to try.
  
  Grind the almonds and 2 tablespoons of the water in a food processor until
  the mixture has a smooth texture when rubbed between your fingers.
  
  Warm the remaining 2 tablespoons of water in a heavy saucepan.  Add the
  sugar and corn syrup. Heat the mixture slowly until the sugar melts, then
  bring it to a boil. Cover and boil for 3 minutes.
  
  Remove the lid but do not stir the mixture.  Heat the mixture to 240
  degrees F (soft ball stage). (You may find it helpful to use a candy
  thermometer) Remove the pan from the heat and add the almond extract.
  
  With the food processor running, slowly add the hot syrup to the almonds
  until the paste forms a ball.
  
  When almond paste is cool, place in a sealable plastic bag or tightly
  covered container and refrigerate. Allow to season for one week. Bring to
  room temperature before using.
  
  Yield:  About 1 pound
