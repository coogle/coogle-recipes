      <step>  You can make a 2-crust pie by doubling the crust recipe I put up there, or
  you can make a crumb topping by mixing 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar,
  and 1 cup flour with a pastry cutter until it's crumbly. For that pie, bake
  it at 400 degrees for 40-50 minutes, until the crust is lightly browned but
  the topping isn't burned. (Check frequently after 35 minutes)
  
  Filling's easy.  Peel, core and slice about 7 apples, enough to make 6-7
  cups. Mix with 1 Tbsp of lemon juice.  In another bowl, mix together 1/4
  cup flour, 3/4 cups granulated sugar, 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. Pour
  it over the apples and mix well.  I like to do this before preparing the
  crust so that it gets a bit liquid and better distributed over the apples.
  Anyway, you fill the pie, top with either pastry or streusel, and bake -
  45-55 minutes at 425 degrees for a pastry-topped pie, and don't forget to
  pierce the top crust in several places. If you want something different,
  you can also add 3/4 to 1 cup of either cranberries or raisins to the
  apples, too.
  
  Another thing - don't forget to lay out foil either on the bottom of the
  oven or on the rack below the pie to save cleanup.
