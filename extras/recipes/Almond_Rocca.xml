      <step>  Almond Rocca: This is not for Almond Roca, yet it is close enough and it is
  real easy. In fact my 14 year old daughter has been making it by herself at
  christmas for the past 4 years. Hope this will meet your needs. It comes
  from the Betty Crocker cookbook, so you may have it on hand already.
  
  Toffee: Butter square pan, 9x9x2 inches. Spread chopped nuts in pan. Heat
  sugar and butter to boiling, stirring constantly. Boil over medium heat,
  stirring constantly, 7 minutes (watch it real close the last minute or
  two).  Immediately spread mixture evenly over nuts in pan. Sprinkle
  chocolate pieces over hot mixture; place a baking sheet over pan so
  contained heat will melt chocolate.  Spread melted chocolate over canndy.
  While hot, cut into 1 1/2 inch squares.  chill until firm.
  
  Now for the changes we use.
  
  When we are going to be giving this as a gift, we melt another 1/2 cup of
  chocolate in the microwave.  Use an 7x7x2 pan (or smaller than the 9x9x2).
  Spread the melted chocolate on top of the buttered pan that is covered with
  the nuts.  After the chocolate is spread on top, sprinkle more nuts on top,
  while chocolate is still warm. Then cut into small sizes. After the candy
  is set, remove from the pan and wrap individually with desert foil. I get
  mine at the bakery supply, or a craft shop.
