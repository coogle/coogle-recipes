      <step>   "Take freshly gathered Apricots not too ripe; to Half their Weight of loaf
  Sugar, add as much Water as will cover the Fruit; boil and skim it: then
  put in the Apricots, and let them remain five or six Minutes; take them up
  without Syruup, and ;ay them on Dishes to cool; boil the Syrup till reduced
  one Half; when the Apricots are cold, put them in Bottles, and cover them
  with equal Quantities of syrup and French Brandy. If the Apricots be
  clingstone, they will require more scalding." Source: Mrs. Mary Randolph's
  Virginia Housewife, 1831
