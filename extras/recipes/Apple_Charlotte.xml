    <directions>
      <step>  Cut a small circle of bread to fit the base of a 1 1/2 pint pyrex bowl, and
  another circle to fit the top. Reserve top circle of bread. Line bowl with
  remaining pieces, first dipping each in melted butter, and overlapping
  slightly where necessary. Peel. core and slice apples thinly. Cook apples,
  water, sugar and rind gently in a saucepan until apples are slightly
  softened but not mushy. Turn apples into lined bowl. Dip top circle of
  bread in melted butter, and cover top. Bake in a moderate oven (375 F - gas
  mark 4) for about 1 hour or until bread is toasted a golden brown. Cool in
  the bowl for a few minutes and turn on to a serving dish.
  
  Serve with fairly thin, pouring custard.
