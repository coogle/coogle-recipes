      <step>  Hi all, Here's a S.African 2 cents worth. An old fashioned and rather
  different recipe from "Leipoldt's Cape Cookery" by the late poet, doctor
  and and cook C.Louis Leipoldt. First: a bit of explanation of terms.
  "Brinjal"=Eggplant, "Blatjang"=chutney. Dr Leipoldt didn't believe in
  weighing down recipes with anything as mundane as measurements. His
  explanations assume that you have good "cooking sense", as I know you all
  do.
  
  This is called "Aubergine with Pine Kernels". I quote verbatim.
  
  "Select your brinjal with care, choosing a moderate-sized one with firm and
  thick flesh; peel it thinly and cut it in slices, on which you strew salt.
  Let the brinjal lie till most of the water has been extracted, then wipe
  the slices and dust them with fine flour which you have previously mixed
  with powdered white pepper, ginger and nutmeg. Slice and brown some onions
  with fat, lay on them the brinjal slices and strew over them plenty of pine
  kernels. Then add enough sherry to cover them and stew with the lid closed
  till everything is well blended. A little chilli and blatjang added much
  improves it." Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V4 #040 by Dave Williams
