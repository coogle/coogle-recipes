    <directions>
      <step>     1) Place the flour, yeast, salt, and ground cumin in a large mixing
  bowl.  Blend well.  Add the water and mix the dough for 2-3 minutes, until
  all the water is absorbed and evenly distributed. The dough will be damp
  and very sticky, but no internal dry areas should appear by the end of the
  mixing.  If they do, mix a few minutes more, or add a little more water and
  mix again.
  
     2) Let the dough rest 5 minutes.  Now sprinkle 1 or 2 tbsps. flour over
  the dough and knead, either in the bowl or on a lightly floured surface for
  5-10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic and only slightly
  sticky.  Add more flour if needed (e.g. in humid weather). Let the dough
  rest for 2 minutes more.
  
     3) The dough should now be very smooth and easy to handle. Knead 30
  seconds more, return the dough to the bowl, cover the bowl with a dish
  towel or large plate, and let rise at room temperature for at least 3
  hours; the dough should almost triple in size.
  
     4) Flour the top of the dough lightly, punch it down, and remove the
  dough from the mixing bowl.  Form the dough into a rectangular loaf and
  place in a well greasad loaf pan, 9-1/4 in. by 5-1/4 in. by 2-3/4 in. Cover
  with a towel and let rise 1 hr., until nicely risen.
  
     5) Bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 35 minutes, until browned on
  top; the bottom of the bread should sound hollow when tapped with the
  finger.  Let the bread cool, then serve.
