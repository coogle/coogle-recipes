      <step>    This one is from New Hampshire. My lady friends there told me that they
  had this for breakfast often as little girls. While I don't want you eating
  bacon every morning, there is something to be said for a few slices of
  old-fashioned cured New England bacon. A lot can be said!
  
    The cream sauce can be made a day or two ahead and then warmed in the
  microwave in no time.
  
    Place the bacon on the toast and top with cream sauce. Then pour black
  coffee and open the windows so that you can smell the fresh New Hampshire
  air. (This works best if you are in New Hampshire!)
