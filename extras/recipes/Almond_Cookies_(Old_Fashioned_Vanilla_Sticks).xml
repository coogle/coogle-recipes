      <step>  (Store these cookies in a tightly covered tin; Mom and Grandma kept
  1/2 an apple with them for moisture. I dislike musty apple flavor so
  keep a paper towel dampened with brandy or vanilla in the tin in an
  open plastic bag. The matured cookies have a delicious chewy, waxy
  texture.
  
  We always made the Vanilla Sticks with unblanched almonds. As with any
  meringue, add the sugar gradually and beat very well AFTER the sugar.)
  
  Beat 4 egg whites stiff, add 1 lb powdered sugar. Beat 15 minutes by
  hand or 5 minutes in electric mixer. Set aside some (about 1/4) for
  icing; add 1 lb. grated almonds, vanilla to flavor, to rest. Roll
  out, cut in strips, glaze with icing; bake in moderate oven.
