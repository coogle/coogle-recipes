      <step>  In a large bowl, beat the shortening and margarine with an electric mixer
  at medium to high spped for about 30 seconds, or until softened.
  
  Add about half of the flour and all of the remaining ingredients and beat
  until thoroughly combined, scraping the sides of the bowl occasionally.
  Beat or stir in the remaining flour. Divide the dough in half. Cover and
  chill for 1 to 2 hours or until easy to handle.
  
  Roll each portion of the dough to 1/8 inch thickness on a lightly floured
  surface.  Cut into the desired shapes. Place 1 inch apart on an ungreased
  cookie sheet. If desired, sprinkle with candies or colord sugar before
  baking.
  
  Bake in a 375 F oven for 7 to 9 minutes or until the edges are firm and the
  bottoms are very lightly browned. Remove the cookies and cool on a rack.
  
  Makes 3 to 4 dozen cookies.
  
  CHOCOLATE SUGAR COOKIES:  Stir 1 tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa powder
  into one half of the recipe. Bake as directed.
  
  NOTE: Sugar cookies also make attractive and economical ornaments. Make the
  dough according to the recipe then flatten the cut out cookies slightly
  with the bottom of a small glass dipped in sugar. Use a drinking straw to
  make a sharp, small hole near the top. If the hole begins to close during
  baking, use the straw to re-form the hole.
