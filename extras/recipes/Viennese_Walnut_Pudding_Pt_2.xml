      <step>  Make the chocolate glaze:
  
  1.Put the chocolate in a 1-quart measuring cup with a pouring spout. In a
  small saucepan, set over medium heat, heat the cream and corn syrup,
  stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the mixture comes to a boil.
  Pour the hot cream over the chocolate. Let the mixture stand for 30
  seconds, to melt the chocolate. Gently whisk until smooth. Stir in the
  vanilla.
  
  Half dip the walnuts and glaze the puddings:
  
  1.One at a time, half dip the walnuts in the warm chocolate glaze and set
  them on a plate.
  
  2.Unmold the puddings and place them on a wire rack set over a baking
  sheet. Pour the warm glaze over the tops of the pudding, letting it spill
  over the sides. Lift the puddings with a metal spatula and set them on
  individual dessert plates.
  
  Decorate the puddings:
  
  1.Strain the chilled coffee-vanilla cream into a large bowl. Discard the
  coffee beans and the vanilla pods. Using a hand-held electric mixer set at
  high speed, beat the cream for 1 to 3 minutes, until it starts to form
  stiff peaks.
  
  2.Fill a pastry bag fitted with a closed star tip (such as Ateco #3) with
  the whipped coffee-vanilla cream. Pipe a shell border around the base of
  each pudding. Pipe a swirled rosette on top of each pudding. Garnish each
  rosette with a half-dipped walnut. These puddings are best when served
  while still warm.
