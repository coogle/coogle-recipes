  If I were having my teeth out again, I'd have soup. I think it's
  comforting, and it's definitely easy to eat! My favorite is Jackie Manni's
  recipe for "cream" of corn soup:
  
  Saute onion and corn in a few tspns of water, adding more if it gets dry.
  Add cornmeal, stirring to avoid lumps, and so all veggies are covered.
  Slowly add water and stir to once again avoid lumps. Bring to a boil, then
  simmer for 40 min. Add salt/tamari at end.
  
  I am not a big soup fan, but I had 2 bowls of this stuff. The best part is,
  you can make a ton and not have to cook for a while.
