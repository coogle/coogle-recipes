      <step>  Cooking the eggplant: Poke the eggplants (say 2, medium sized ones) with a
  knife, and insert slivers of garlic in the slits. The eggplant can be
  roasted either in a conv. oven, a microwave, or ideally, on a slow charcoal
  grill.  When they are done (they become kinda' limp), peel, and mash up the
  insides. Use a knife to cut up the long fibres. Seasoning: In a wok, heat
  some oil, and add chopped onions, and chopped ginger. Fry till the onions
  are semi-browned, and then add the mashed eggplant. Add salt, and pepper to
  taste. Season with lots of chopped cilantro (coriander leaves). Since the
  eggplant is already cooked, you need not cook for long in the wok... just
  long enough to mix things up good. A tomato or two chopped fine, and added
  with the eggplant also tastes good. Alternative sesoning: Chop onions,
  ginger, tomatoes, and cilantro, and mix *cold* with the mashed eggplant,
  and a few table spoons of mustard oil. The mustard oil gives a nice tangy
  taste. Look for mustard oil in your nearest Indian grocery store. (Salt and
  pepper too.)
