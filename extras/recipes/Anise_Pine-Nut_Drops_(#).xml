      <step>  * Prepare Basic Holiday Cookie dough, with the following changes:
  Substitute 3/4 tsp. anise flavoring for vanila. Wrap in plastic and
  refrigerate until well chilled. For each cookie, roll 1 round teaspoon
  dough in pine nuts; you'll need about 1/2 cup nuts total. Place on
  ungreased baking sheets. Bake in 350 F. oven for 10-12 minutes. Cool on
  wire racks. Makes 24 cookies. MC formatting by bobbi744@sojourn.com
