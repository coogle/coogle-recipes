      <step>  Cut corn from cobs, boil cobs to make stock. Make roux, add onions, garlic,
  ham, green pepper, corn, and fry.  Add tomatoes and cook down. Add stock
  and seasoning. We make this every year with the latter part of the corn
  crop, since the corn doesn't have to be too tender. We never have written
  down proportions. Instead of ham, I now use a little olive oil. We also add
  shrimp or crawfish, and sometimes we use only a little liquid and add
  butter beans, and serve it as a vegetable
