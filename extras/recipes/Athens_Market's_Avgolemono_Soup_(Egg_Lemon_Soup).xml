    <directions>
      <step>  Place chicken, water, and desired amount of salt in heavy pot. Bring to
  boil. Reduce heat and simmer for approximately 1 1/2 to 2 hours, skimming
  foam off top as necessary. Add more water, as necessary, so you will end up
  with 3 quarts of chicken stock. Remove chicken and set aside for later use.
  Strain chicken stock into clean saucepan, reserving 3 cups. Bring stock in
  saucepan to boil. Add rice and bring back to boil. Reduce heat and simmer
  for 30 minutes or until rice is soft. In a large measuring cup, place lemon
  juice with one cup of reserved chicken stock. Set aside. In large mixing
  bowl beat eggs on high speed for 4 minutes. Reduce speed to medium and
  continue beating while you slowly add lemon juice and stock mixture. Into
  same mixture, pour 2 cups of reserved chicken stock slowly, while
  continuously mixing. Turn mixer off. Pour egg and lemon mixture slowly into
  saucepan of rice and stock, stirring continually. Continue to stir for one
  minute while soup cooks. Remove from heat. Salt and pepper to taste. Serve
  hot. NOTE: You can chop up the cooked chicken into small chunks and add it
  to the soup. Or use the chicken to make chicken salad, sandwiches, etc.
