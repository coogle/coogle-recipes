      <step>  Asparagus is low-calorie and spiked with vitamins A &amp;b
  C. Allow about To Prepare: Break off tough ends as far
  down as stalks snap easily. For spears, tie with
  string. Or, cut each stalk into 1 inch pieces. Cooking
  Spears: In deep, narrow pan or asparagus pot, heat 1"
  salted water to boiling. Place asparagus upright in
  pot. Heat to boiling, reduce heat. Boil uncovered for
  5 minutes. Cover and boil 2-3 minutes longer. Drain.
  Cooking pieces: Cook lower stalk pieces uncovered in
  1" boiling water for 6 minutes. Add tips, cover, and
  cook until tender, about 1-2 minutes. Drain. Steaming:
  Place steamer or basket in 1/2" water (water should
  not touch basket). Place asparagus in basket. Cover
  tightly and heat to boiling. Reduce heat and steam
  until tender, about 6 minutes. Microwave: Cover and
  nuke asparagus spears or 1" pieces and 1/4 c water in
  2 qt casserole on high 4 minutes. Turn asparagus over.
  Cover and nuke until tender crisp, about 3 minutes
  longer. Let stand 1 minute and drain.
