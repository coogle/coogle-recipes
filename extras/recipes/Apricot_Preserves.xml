      <step>  hot water
  
  Cook apricots and sugar to setting point, continually skimming off foam.
  Shortly before done, add lemon juice. Remove from heat. Stir in 'Preserving
  Aid' dissolved in hot water. Pour into hot, dry, sterilized jars. Seal jars
  with cellophane the top of which has been dipped in rum and smooth the
  overhang over the jars' necks, tying with thin twine.
  
  Makes 12 half-liter jars and one quarter-liter jar. (Between 13 and 14 1
  pint jars).
  
  "Einsiedehilfe" ('Preserving Aid') is sold (in Austria) in 15 gram packages
  and consists of 65 percent sugar and 35 percent benzoic acid.
  
  To test for setting point:  Spoon a little of the conserve onto a chilled
  saucer. Leave for a few minutes - then hold saucer upside down. If conserve
  doesn't run, then setting point has been reached.
