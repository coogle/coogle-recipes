      <step>  *For the Cinnamon Caramel Sauce, combine 1 cup of the sugar and 1/3 cup of
  the water in a medium saucepan set on medium-high heat. Bring to a boil,
  swirling the pan over the heat to dissolve the sugar - don't stir the
  mixture. Cover the pan tightly and boil for 4-5 minutes, until the bubbles
  are thick and large. Uncover and continue boiling, swirling the pan
  constantly in a circular motion. Once the color begins to darken, continue
  to cook for approximately 1 minute longer, until light brown in color.
  Remove from the heat and keep swirling the pan, as the caramel will
  continue to darken from the heat in the pan. Add the cinnamon and swirl to
  mix it into the caramel. Pour the caramel into a 2-quart (2-1) round glass
  baking dish that is approximately 8-9 inches (20-23 cm) wide at the top,
  turning to coat the bottom and halfway up the sides with whe caramel. Set
  aside.
  
  *For the Apple Flan, preheat the oven to 350F (180C). Bring the 5 cups of
  water to a boil and keep at a simmer until needed. In a medium bowl, whisk
  together the egg yolks, eggs and the sugar. Stir in the half-and-half milk,
  applesauce and vanilla. Pour into the caramel-coated bowl and set the bowl
  of custard into a 9x13-inch (23x33-cm) baking dish. Place the custard in
  the oven and pour the boiling water into the larger baking dish. sake for
  90 mins, until the edges are just set and the center is still slightly
  liquid. Remove from the oven and cool for 15 minutes. Cover and refrigerate
  for at least 2 hours or overnight.
  
  To unmold, place the baking dish in a pan of hot water for 1 minute to
  soften the caramel. Place a serving plate over the custard and invert the 2
  dishes. Cut into wedges and drizzle with some of doe sauce before serving.
