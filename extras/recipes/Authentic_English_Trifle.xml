      <step>  First, make a soft, rich custard: beat 4 egg yolks until light and pale
  yellow.  Heat 2 cups light cream with 1/4 cup sugar and 1 tablespoon orange
  flower water or vanilla. Add beaten egg yolks, while beating very hard.
  Then cook without boiling, stirring continuously until custard coats the
  spoon.  Remove to a bowl. Cover and refrigerate until well chilled. Cut a
  two-layer sponge cake (that you bake or buy) into finger-length pieces.
  Spread each one on one side with raspberry jam and quickly dip in 1/2 cup
  sherry. Place half these sponge fingers in the bottom of a deep cut-glass
  bowl. Cover with half the custard. Whip 2 cups cream. Sweeten with 1/2 cup
  icing sugar and vanilla to taste. Cover custard with half the whipped
  cream.  Make a second layer on top of all this. Top with a dozen or so
  toasted almonds, standing them upright in the cream, add a few slivers of
  angelica - or use small roses instead of almonds and angelica. Refrigerate
  at least 12 hours. This beautiful dessert never fails to create a
  sensation, yet is easy to prepare.
