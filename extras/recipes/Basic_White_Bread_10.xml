      <step>  STIR YEAST AND SUGAR into water; let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.
  For food processor fitted with metal blade or mixer with dough hook, put
  remaining bread ingredients into bowl. Turn machine on and slowly add yeast
  mixture. Mix until dough cleans sides of bowl. If dough is too sticky, add
  more flour by the tablespoon, working it in before adding more. If dough is
  dry and crumbly, add more water by the teaspoon, working it in before
  adding more. Once desired consistency is achieved (moist but not too
  sticky), mix dough until well-kneaded, uniformly supple and elastic, about
  40 seconds in food processor, or 6 minutes in mixer. If mixing by hand, put
  ingredients into large bowl and make well in center. Pour yeast mixture
  into well and work into ingredients in bowl, then knead on floured board
  until dough is elastic and smooth, about 10 minutes. Transfer dough to
  large plastic bag, squeeze out air and seal top. Place in bowl. Let rise in
  warm spot until doubled, about 1-to-1 1/2 hours. Oil 8-cup-capacity bread
  pan (9-inch). Punch dough down and shape to fit pan. Cover loosely with
  plastic. Let rise in warm spot until doubled, about 1 hour. 15 minutes
  before baking, put rack in center of oven; set oven at 375F. When dough has
  doubled, brush top with egg white. Bake until loaf is golden and sounds
  hollow when rapped on bottom, about 35 minutes. Immediately remove loaf
