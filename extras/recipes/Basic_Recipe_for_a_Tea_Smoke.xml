    <directions>
      <step>  Take 3 sheets of heavy-duty aluminum foil 15 inches square and start
  rolling the edges under to from a circle that fits in the bottom of your
  Dutch oven -- in our case, a foil saucer approximately 5 inches in
  diamerter.  When the edge is rolled to about 1 inch high, stop and flatten
  it. Then, depress the center to hold the smoke ingredients.
  
  In the depression of the aluminum foil saucer first sprinkle the rice, then
  the sugar, cloves and the contents of the tea bags. The order of
  ingredients is very important. Place the foil dish in Dutch oven, cover
  tightly and cook over high heat until ingredients in the foil start smoking
  ~- about 5 minutes.
  
  Brush a steamer platform with the olive oil.  Place the chicken on
  platform, skinned side up.  Put into Dutch oven over the smoke ingredients,
  cover and continue smoking over high heat until done -- about 11 minutes.
