      <step>  Full Load Serves 4 - 6 -- Half Load (2-4):
  
  *NOTE: A Popeil measuring cup
  
  **NOTE: Or equivalent to 2 eggs, beaten
  
  Note: The Full Load recipe calls for 1 T olive oil. The half load recipe
  calls for 1 T olive oil. I omit the oil completely. Because I eliminate the
  oil I do heat the dye before I extrude. What I do is to heat up about 34/ C
  water in a 1 C measurement in the microwave..NOT TO BOILING THOUGH. Then
  when the water is warm enough I remove it from the microwave and lower the
  dye into it. DON'T DROP the dye ....lower it carefully to avoid splashes
  and nasty burns. I usually let it sit in the hot water for about 1 - 1/2
  minutes and the put it on the machine and start extruding immediately.
  
  Equivalents: One Popeil Measuring Cup is equivalent to 1 2/3 C standard
  measurement.
  
  Use the mix and then extrude in any shape that you prefer. We made this
  into fettucine.
  
  This was very good!!
