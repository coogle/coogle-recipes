    <directions>
      <step>  *To prepare the artichokes: Squeeze juice from 2 lemon halves into large
  bowl of cold water; add squeezed lemon halves. Cut off top half of each
  artichoke and discard. Cut off stem of artichoke. Starting at base, bend
  tough outer leaves back and snap off where they break naturally, leaving
  tender inner leaves. Using small sharp knife, trim outside of base until no
  dark green areas remain. Scoop out fibrous choke and small purple-tipped
  leaves, using spoon. Rub exposed areas with lemon half. Place in lemon
  water until ready to use or up to 2 hours.
  
  Heat oven to 400Ã¸F. Mix breadcrumbs and oil in medium bowl. Spread mixture
  on large rimmed baking sheet. Bake until golden on edges, stirring
  occasionally, about 10 minutes. Transfer to large bowl. Mix in lemon juice,
  oregano, garlic and lemon peel. Season with salt and pepper.
  
  Drain artichokes. Gently pull leaves outward from center until leaves open
  slightly. Fill artichoke cavities with bread stuffing. Pack stuffing
  between leaves. Place artichokes in 13x9x2 glass baking dish. Dot tops with
  butter. Pour 1/2 cup water into dish.
  
  Cover dish with foil; bake until wooden skewer pierces artichokes easily;
  adding more water as necessary, about 40 minutes. Remove foil. Continue
  baking until tops are golden, about 20 minutes.
  
  Serve with lemon wedges.
