  By this date, most people would have used commercial baking ponder, which
  was readily available. The flour in this mixture would make it thicken, as
  well as raise, a mixture. The staying power of this or any other baking
  powder is dependent on how well moisture is excluded from the powder.
  Sift all together six times; then put in cans and keep air tight. This is a
  good baking powder and will keep a long time.
