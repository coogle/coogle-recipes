      <step>  Beat eggs over warm water until thick and lemon colored, about 10 to 15
  minutes.  Add sugar gradually, beating constantly, until all the sugar has
  been used up.  Mix in the flour, one cup at a time, until the mixture is
  well blended.  Add vanilla and anise flavor.  Turn into well greased and
  lightly floured long narrow baking tins.  Bake in a preheated 375F oven
  until delicately browned.  Watch carefully, so that the sweet bread does
  not burn.  If the oven is too hot reduce to 350F. Cool. Sprinkle with
  powdered sugar.  Slice 1/2 inch thick, spread on a baking sheet, return to
  250F oven and let toast gently for 10 min. or until a very light golden
  color.

  Recipe By     : The Complete Bread Cookbook
  NOTES : This is very OLD European recipe was a gift to us from a famous
       chef.
       The bread is lightly flavored, crisp and sweet.  Uniquely
       delicate, it
       is an excellent "dunker," served with steaming hot coffee or spice
       tea.
       The ladies often dipped the sliced Vienna bread i cognac or sweet
       wine
       - --the very nicest way imaginable of having your cake and eating
       it too!
