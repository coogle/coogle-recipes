    <directions>
      <step>  Combine eggs, milk, and salt in bowl. Beat gently. Place butter in skillet
  and heat until butter is very slightly browned. Add eggs and immediately
  stir them briskly with back of fork. When the eggs have thickened and there
  are no more liquid eggs in skillet, stop stirring and continue cooking for
  a few seconds, gently shaking the pan back and forth over the heat. Take
  skillet off fire and with fork fold one-third of omelet over center. Then
  fold other third over first. Slide omelet onto heated serving dish.
  COMMENTS French omelets are famous for their smoothness and lightness. This
  is because the eggs are cooked very quickly and remain moist -- as they
  should. Once the butter is hot, it does not take more than two minutes to
  make the omelet itself. There is in every French household an "omelet
  skillet," used only for that purpose. It is a cast iron or heavy aluminum
  skillet, approximately 9-inches across. It is never washed but is carefully
  wiped after each use with paper towels. If it becomes necessary to wash it,
  it is scoured with a scouring pad, then oiled and wiped with paper. Some
  omelet skillets are larger for bigger omelets, but it is never advisable to
  make an omelet of more than 4 eggs. It is much easier to cook two 3-egg
  omelets than a 6-egg one. The eggs should be taken out of the refrigerator
  one hour before cooking. They are beaten lightly, just enough to break them
  and blend the whites and yolks together. This is done at the last minute.
  The one essential factor in the successful making of an omelet is the
  temperature of the butter. The eggs are not poured into the skillet until
  the butter bubbles and turns "noisette" (hazelnut), that is, slightly
  brown. Then the eggs are turned into the skillet and the omelet is briskly
  made. Many cooks, just before serving, rub a piece of butter over the top
  of the omelet to give it a "shine," which does not make it any better but
  does make it more appetizing. Source: The Art of French Cooking by Fernande
