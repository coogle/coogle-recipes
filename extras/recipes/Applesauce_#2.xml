  My favorite way to make applesauce is in the microwave, as this retains all
  of the flavor and goodness of the fruit. Simply cut the fruit in half (or
  in quarters), place it in a 2 or 3 quart microwaveable corningware
  casserole, cover it, and microwave on high for 12 to 15 minutes. You might
  want to check for doneness periodically. When the apples are soft, let cool
  a bit, and then force through a ricer into a bowl. Sweeten to taste,
  depending on the apple variety, and season to taste with cinnamon, nutmeg,
  ginger, and/or allspice. This freezes well in jam jars or plastic
  containers.
