      <step>  Place asparagus on a platter and let cool to room temperature.
  
  Pass the oil, vinegar, salt and pepper around the table.  Pour some oil
  (about 2 T) and some vinegar (about 1 t) onto each plate.  (Place a fork
  underneath the top of your plate, tilting the plate gently toward you, and
  pour the vinaigrette into the bottom of each plate.)  Sprinkle with salt
  and pepper.
  
  Serve the asparagus.  Pick up a piece of asparagus from the platter with
  your hands and stir the vinaigrette with it a little before popping the tip
  in your mouth.  Continue stirring and eating until you get to the tougher
  bottom part of the stem.  Start over with a new piece, adding more oil and
  vinegar as needed.  Pass finger bowls or damp towels after this entree!

  NOTES : Asparagus is a symbol of spring in Southwest France.  Usually
       served with a sharp vinaigrette in Gascony.
