    <directions>
      <step>  Preheat the oven to broil.  Rinse chicken under running water, remove all
  visible fat and any pieces of kidney left in the body cavity. Pat dry
  inside and out with paper towels. Place the garlic, salt, pepper and lemon
  juice in the bowl of mini-processor and process until smooth or mince the
  garlic and mix well with other seasonings. Carefully separate the chicken's
  skin form its flesh and rub the garlic mixture between skin and flesh; rub
  the inside and out very well. Tie the chicken and place it breast-side down
  in a roasting pan with 1/2-inch water or chicken stock. Turn the oven down
  to 400 degrees but leave it on broil. Place the pan in the lowest rack of
  the oven. Roast for 50 minutes.
  
  Turn the chicken breast side up and add more liquid if necessary to
  maintain 1/2 inch at the bottom of the pan. Continue to roast another 20
  minutes or until the breast is well browned. Remove fron the oven, remove
  the chicken to a cutting board and cover loosely to keep warm. Adjust the
  liquid level in the roasting pan again and add potato slices. Roast for
  about 10 minutes or just until potaoes colour slightly. Transfer potatoes
  to serving platter, carve chicken and place the pieces on top of the
  potatoes.
