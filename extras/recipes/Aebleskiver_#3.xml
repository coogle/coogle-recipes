      <step>   A couple of months back there was a discussion on how to make Aebleskiver.
  As a lover of Aebleskiver it really hurt me to see how "distorted" some of
  these reci pes were. So when I bought the book "Mad", by Ingeborg Suhr from
  1942 I decided to enlighten you poor netters.  The following three recipes
  are from the country where Aebleskiver originated and are the "real thing".
  Although Ingeborg Suhr does not say anything about it I would suggest
  serving with either sifted confectioners sugar, blackberry jam or both. At
  Christmas I would suggest serving with glogg.
  
   Whisk flour with half the milk, add egg yolks, melted butter, beer, salt,
  and the rest of the milk. Add egg whites that have been whipped stiff. Bake
  as above. See Aebleskiver #1.
