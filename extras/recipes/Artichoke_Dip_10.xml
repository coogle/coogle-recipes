  Drain artichoke hearts. A food processor may be used to chop the artichoke
  hearts. Mix all ingredients together in a oven proof, small round casserole
  dish. Place in pre-heated oven at 350-F degrees and bake about 20-25
  minutes, or until top is brown and dip is hot and bubbly. Serve hot as a
  dip with tortilla chips or sourdough bread slices. This is always a
  favorite at every festivity!
