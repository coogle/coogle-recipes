    <directions>
      <step>  1. Bring 1 inch of water to boil in large pot. Put asparagus in steamer
  basket, then carefully place steamer basket in pot. Cover and steam over
  
  medium-high heat until asparagus is just tender, about 2 minutes. Remove
  
  asparagus and set aside. Reserve 1 cup of the asparagus steaming liquid.
  
  2. Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat. Add shallots- saute,
  stirring occasionally to separate rings, until crisp and light brown, about
  10 minutes. Add mushrooms, increase heat to medium-high, and saut6
  
  until they soften and release their juices, about 5 minutes longer. Season
  with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper or to taste.
  
  3. Add asparagus and reserved cooking liquid. Simmer until asparagus is
  heated through and sauce has thickened a bit, about 2 minutes longer.
  Adjust seasonings.

  Finishing a minute or less
  
  NOTES : Enough for 1 pound of pasta.  If pencil thin asparagus are
  available, they don't need to be halved, but thicker asparagus should be
  sliced in half, and very thick pieces need to be quartered. You may add 1/4
  cup Parmesan cheese when you toss the sauce with pasta, preferably
  linguine, then offer extra Parmesan at the table.
