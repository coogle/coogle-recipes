    <directions>
      <step>  "Vinegar is a preservative &amp; therefore the vindaloo may be kept in the
  refrigerator for several days before using. In fact, the flavour are
  intensified if the vindaloo is eaten one or two days before cooking, warm
  slightly. ... The vindaloo requires that a substantial amount of oil be
  used in the preparation. For our purpose &amp; without compromising the flavor,
  I have suggested that the excess oil be poured off before dining. Toasting
  &amp; grinding the whole spice seeds is the old-time method &amp; very effective in
  deriving the most flavor. However, I have also lightly toasted ground
  spices, which is an improvement over using them directly from the
  container. The recipe is one prepared by the Bhatia Christians of Calcutta,
  a group of Anglo-Indians who have intermarried with Bengali Indians."
  
  Lightly toast the coriander, poppy, mustard seeds, &amp; cumin seeds in a dry
  skillet for 2 or 3 minutes until the aroma is released. Grind the seeds in
  a processor to a fine powder. Set aside. Heat the oil in a pan &amp; add all
  the toasted dry spices, the chili flakes ginger and garlic. Stir fry over
  moderately low heat for 2 min. Add the meat &amp; stir continuously for 10
  minutes as the meat browns. Add the water, cover the pan &amp; cook until the
  meats are tender, about 1 hour. When the meats have been fully tenderized,
  add the vinegar &amp; continue to cook until the vinegar evaporates &amp; the oil
  has risen. This is an indication that the vindaloo is ready. At this stage,
  all the oil may be poured off before serving. Serve warm with plain white
  rice &amp; masoor dal.
