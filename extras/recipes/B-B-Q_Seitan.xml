      <step>  Prep time: 1-1/2 to 2 hours (most of time is in cooking)
  
  Heat oil in a pan over medium heat and fry Seitan pieces for a few minutes
  on each side until lightly browned.  Soak kombu until soft, then cut into
  sixteen pieces.  Line bottom of 9-inch baking dish with half the kombu.
  Place a piece of fried Seitan on each piece of kombu, overlapping if
  necessary, to make an even layer.  Place remaining pieces of kombu on top
  of each piece of Seitan.  Pour B-B-Q sauce on top, then spread with a
  spoon to cover surfaces.  Gently add enough water so that the Seitan
  pieces are almost floating.  Cover and bake at 350 F. for one hour.  Add
  more water if necessary to keep Seitan very moist.
