      <step>  Sift flour once, measure, add 1/4 cup sugar, and sift together four times.
  Beat egg whites and salt with rotary egg beater or flat wire whisk. When
  foamy, add cream of tartar and continue beating until eggs are stiff enough
  to hold up in peaks, but not dry. Add remaining I cup sugar, 2 tablespoons
  at a time, beating with rotary egg beater or whisk after each addition
  until sugar is just blended. Fold in flavoring. Then sift about 1/4 cup
  flour over mixture and fold in lightly; repeat until all is used. Turn into
  ungreased angel food pan. Cut gently through batter with knife to remove
  air bubbles. Bake in slow oven (325 degrees F) 45 to 50 minutes Remove from
  oven and invert pan 1 hour, or until cold. Spread Raspberry Icing thinly on
  top and sides of cake. Angel Food Cake is often served plain or sprinkled
  lightly with confectioners'sugar. For Large Angel Food Cake, use above
  recipe, increasing sugar and egg whites to 1 1/2 cups each. Add 1/4 cup of
  the sugar to flour and 1 1/4 cups to egg whites. Bake in slow oven (325
  degrees F) 1 hour. Note: Remove eggs from refrigerator several hours be-
  fore using. They beat up lighter and more easily when at room temperature,
  and give increased fineness of grain and delicacy of texture to angel food
  cakes. Kate Smith Collection 1940  Published by General Foods Barb From
