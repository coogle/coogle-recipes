  From _Food of Life_, by Najmieh Batmanglij.  Barbari bread is a flat 1-1.5
  inch thick loaf. It may be round or oval shaped.
  
  Dissolve yeast in 1 cup warm water.  Add sugar and set aside for 10
  minutes. Pour yeast mixture in large bowl or food processor, add 2 cups
  warm water, and salt--mix well. Gradually add flour while stirring
  constantly.  After 6 cups flour have been added, knead by hand, add the
  rest of the flour if needed until the dough is not sticky.
  
  Pour oil in a large bowl and place dough in bowl.  Cover with a clean damp
  towel and let rise 4 hours in warm dark place without moving.  Punch air
  out while dough is in the bowl. Flip dough over and return to bowl. Cover
  with new damp towel and allow to rise 2 hours.
  
  Place cookie sheet in center of oven and preheat to 500 degrees F.  Divide
  dough into 11 parts, each piece about 5 inches in diameter.  Dust a tray
  with corn meal and place loaves on tray. With damp hands, press fingertips
  into each loaf, then sprinkle tops with sesame seeds.
  
  Put loaves on the cookie sheet, corn meal side down, and bake sesame side
  for 8 miuntes in closed oven.  Turn bread over and bake corn meal side down
  for 4 minutes in closed oven.  Remove loaves from oven. Cover with clean
  towel, serve hot or wrap in foil and freeze(toast before serving.)
