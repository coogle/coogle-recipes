    <directions>
      <step>  Place beans in large pot; add water to cover by at least 2 inches. Soak
  overnight or use quick-cook method: Bring to a boil, cook 2 minutes, then
  remove from heat, cover and let sit for 1 hour.
  
  Drain beans, then return to pot and add wataer to cover by 1 inch. Add
  onions and garlic. For a Mexican flavor, add cilantro and mint; for an
  Italian flavor, add a bay leaf or two.
  
  Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer uncovered, stirring once or
  twice, for 1 1/2 - 2 hours, or until the beans are tender. Add water as
  needed, enough to cover beans with a little extra on top, but don't add too
  much or the beans "drown" and their flavor is compromised. Season to taste
  with salt.
  
  Yields about 6 cups of cooked beans.
