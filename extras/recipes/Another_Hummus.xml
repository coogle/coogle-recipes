      <step>  1-2 cans garbanzos 1/4 - 1/2 cup fat-free yogurt (opt). 1 T lemon juice 2-4
  garlic cloves, minced or crushed 1 Pn pinch of coriander 4 - 6 drops of
  toasted sesame oil*
  
  * (optional, negligible fat, adds flavor)  Must be TOASTED SESAME OIL (I
  found in Asian food section of HFS.Very strong flavor, a bottle should last
  for years)
  
  Mash garbanzos (I mash with a potato masher, then run in batches in
  blender, because I like my hummus smooth)  Mix in everything else, tasting
  as you go along.  Salt can be added, if you like. I also add some red
  pepper on the top before serving. Chilling seems to mix the flavors. Serve
  with pita wedges.
  
  With the sesame oil you really get the taste without all the fat. Play
  around with it.  I have never tasted hummus that was the same, it all
  varies depending on who makes it!  Oh yes, cucumber goes well with this (on
  top of pita wedge).
