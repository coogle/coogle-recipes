    <directions>
      <step>  1.Peel onions and chop into coarse pieces. Melt the lard in a heavy 6-to-8
  quart Dutch oven. Saute the onion in the lard until translucent. Heat
  should be low in order not to brown the onions.
  
  2.When onions become transluscent add the beef. Stir so that during this
  part of the process, which should last about 10 minutes, the meat will be
  sauteed with the onions.
  
  3.Meanwhile chop and crush the garlic with a little salt using the flat
  side of a heavy knife.
  
  4.Remove the Dutch oven from the heat.Stir in paprika and the garlic. Stir
  rapidly with a wooden spoon.Immediately after paprika is absorbed, add 21/2
  quarts WARM WATER. (cold water toughens the meat if you add it while the
  meat is frying.)
  
  5.Replace the Dutch oven over low heat and cook for about an hour.
  
  6.While the meat is cooking, peel the tomato, then cut it into 1-inch
  pieces.
  
  Core the green pepper and slice into rings. Peel potatoes and cut into
  3/4-inch dice.
  
  7.After the meat has been cooking for about an hour ( the time depends on
  the cut of the meat) add the cut-up tomato and green peppers and enough
  water to give a soup consistency. Add a little salt. Simmer slowly for
  another 30 minutes.
  
  8.Add the potatoes and cook the goulash till the potatoes are done. Adjust
  salt.
  
  9.Add the dumplings to the goulash and cook 2 to 3 minutes.
  
  10.Serve the goulash steaming hot in large extra-deep bowls. The meat
  should be tender, but not falling apart. Serve with lots of italian bread
  to sop up the fabulous gravy. ( by the way the italian bread is not
  authentic Hungarian, you would need rye bread for that , but it will do)
  
  Makes 8 servings
  
  Little Dumplings: Mix the egg with the flour and salt. Spoon the mixture
  into the boiling goulash, using 1/4 teaspoon at a time. Cook with the
  goulash for 2 to 3 minutes just before you are ready to serve.
