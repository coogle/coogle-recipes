      <step>  Heat the oven to 350F.  Generously grease two 10-by-14-inch or larger
  baking shets.  Stir together the honey, sugar, and kirsch in a medium-sized
  saucepan over medium heat.  Heat the mixture, stirring, until the sugar
  completely dissolves and the mixture is hot but not boiling.  Remove from
  the heat and stir in the spices, lemon peel, candied peels, and almonds
  until completely incorporated.  Stirring vigorously, gradually ad 2 1/4
  cups of flour to the pan; the mixture will become very stiff.  If the
  mixture feels sticky and too soft to roll out, stir or knead in a bit more
  flour, but be careful not to overflour.  Set the mixture aside until cooled
  to barely warm.
  
  Sprinkle a work surface generously with flour.  Divide the dough in half.
  Roll out half of dough into an 8 1/2-by-13-inch rectangle, frequently
  running a spatula under the dough and dusting the work surface.  As needed,
  also dust the top of the dough and the rolling pin with flour.  Transfer
  the dough to a prepared baking sheet.  Repeat with the second half of the
  dough.  Prick the dough lightly all over with the tines of a fork.
  
  Stagger the baking sheets on racks in the center third of the oven; switch
  positions halfway through the baking to ensure even browning.  Bake for 13
  to 16 minutes or until the dough top is just tinged with brown and slightly
  darker on the edges; avoid overbaking, as cookies will become crunchy and
  hard.  Carefully run a spatula under the dough rectangles to loosen them
  from the pans.
  
  When just cool enough to handle, transfer the rectangles to a cutting board
  and cut away any uneven, dry edges using a large serrated knife.  Deeply
  score the rectangles, but do not cut completely through the surface,
  lengthwise and crosswise, to yield 1-by-2 1/2-inch bars. Return the scored
  rectangles to the baking sheets.  In a small saucepan stir together the
  powdered sugar, vanilla, and 3 tablespoons of water until thoroughly
  blended.  Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring.  Boil, stirring, for 20 to
  30 seconds, until smooth, very fluid, and translucent.  Divide the mixture
  between the rectangles, pour over the top and quickly spread the glaze over
  the entire surface.  Let stand until the glaze sets and turns white again,
  about 1 hour.  Bend the rectangles to break apart or cut through the score
  marks to separate into bars.  Let stand until the glaze is dry and hard.
  Pack airtight.  Store for up to 3 weeks or more.
  
  Makes 50 to 60 1-by-2 1/2-inch bars.
