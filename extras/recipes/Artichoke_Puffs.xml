      <step>  Preheat oven to 450. Coat baking sheets with nonstick cooking spray.
  Heat milk, oil &amp; salt in medium sized heavy saucepan. As soon as mix
  comes to a boil, remove from heat. Immediately stir in flour with
  wooden spoon; beat until dough pulls away from sides of pan. Bet in
  eggs &amp; whites, one at a time, beating after each addition, until mix
  is smooth &amp; glossy. Place mounds of dough ( about the size of a large
  walnut) on sheets, leaving 1 1/2" between. Flatten with moistened
  fingertips to 1/2" thickness. Bake in 450 oven for 10 minutes. Reduce
  temp to 400. Bake 20 minutes or more until puffed, golden &amp; lightly
  crusty. Remove puffs from sheets to rack to cool. To fill, cut tops
  from puffs. Spoon in Artichoke filling. Replace tops. To heat, place
  puffs on sheet. Cover lightly with foil. Bake in preheated 375 oven
  10 minutes. The stuffed puffs can be frozen. To reheat, place frozen
  on baking sheets. Cover lightly with foil. Bake in preheated 375 oven
  for 20 minutes.
