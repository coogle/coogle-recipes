    <directions>
      <step>  Preheat the oven to 225 degrees. Lightly grease two cookie sheets or, if
  you prefer, grease parchment or waxed paper spread on cookie sheets.
  
  In a large bowl, beat the egg whites with the salt or cream of tartar until
  the whites make soft peaks. To make a tender meringue, gradually add all
  but 2 tablespoons of the sugar as you continue to beat. Check to see if the
  sugar has dissolved by pinching the meringue. When you can no longer feel
  the crystals, fold in the remaining sugar, then the vanilla extract, and
  finally the apricots and almonds.
  
  Drop neat spoonfuls of the meringue batter onto the cookie sheets; give
  them attractive peaks, as they will not spread or change their shape. Bake
  for 1hour without opening the door. Turn off the oven and keep them in the
  unopened oven for at least another hour or as long as overnight. Remove the
  cookies with a spatula. Store them in airtight tins or, closed tightly in a
  plastic bag, in the freezer, where they will keep indefinitely.
  
  NOTES : These light, tender meringue cookies are a good way to use up extra
  egg whites.
