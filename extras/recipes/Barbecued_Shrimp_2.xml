      <step>        2 dz large shrimp with
  :          heads and shells
  :          (about 1 pound)
  
  :          Seasoning mix
        1 ts red pepper (cayenne)
        1 ts black pepper
      1/2 ts salt
      1/2 ts crushed red pepper
      1/2 ts dried thyme leaves
      1/2 ts dried rosemary leaves,
  :          crushed
      1/2 ts dried oregano leaves
      1/4 lb plus 5 tb unsalted butter
    1-1/2 ts minced garlic
        1 ts Worcestershire sauce
      1/2 c  shrimp stock  (see below)
      1/4    beer at room temperature
  :          Shrimp Stock
        2 qt cold water
        2 lb rinsed shrimp heads
  :           and/or shells
  Rinse shrimp in cold water and drain well.  Pinch off and discard
  head, but leave as much of the fat in the head attached to the body
  (I said it would taste good; not that it would be good for you!).
  
  In a small bowl combine the seasoning mix ingredients.  Combine 1
  stick of the butter, the garlic, Worcestershire, and seasoning mix in
  a large skillet over high heat.  When the butter is melted, add the
  shrimp. Cook for 2 minutes, shaking the pan (versus stirring) in a
  back-and-forth motion.  Add the remaining 5 tbsp butter and the
  stock; cook and shake pan for 2 minutes.  Add the beer and cook and
  shake the pan 1 minute longer. Remove from heat.
  
  Serve immediately in bowls with lots of French bread (use the bread
  to soak up the sauce!).
  Shrimp Stock Place water and shrimp parts in a stock pot or large
  saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, then gently simmer at least
  4 hours, preferably 8, replenishing the water as needed to keep about
  1 quart of liquid in the pan. The pot may be uncovered or set a lid
  on it askew. Strain, cool, and refrigerate until ready to use.
  
  If in a hurry, simmer 20 to 30 minutes. Walt MM
  
  Enjoy!!!
