  This rich cream is a combination of 2 strong flavours: the smoky one of
  aubergines prepared as below, and the strong taste of tahina sharpened by
  lemon and garlic. It is exciting and vulgarly seductive. The ingredients
  are added almost entirely to taste, the harmony of flavours depending
  largely on the size and flavour the aubergines used. The quantities below
  give a fairly large amount, enough to be served as a dip at a party.
  
  Cook the aubergines over charcoal or under a gas flame or electricgrill
  until the skin blackens and blisters. Peel and wash the aubergines, and
  squeeze out as much of the bitter juice as possible. Crush the garlic
  cloves with salt. Mash the aubergines with a potato masher or a fork, then
  add the crushed garlic and  little more salt, and pound to a smooth, creamy
  puree.
  
  Add the tahina paste and lemon juice alternately, beating well or blending
  for a few seconds between each addition. Taste and add more salt, lemon
  juice, garlic or tahina if you think it is necessary, and if you like, a
  little cumin.
  
  Pour the cream into a bowl or a few smaller serving dishes. Garnish with
  finely chopped parsley and black olives, oe with Arab or other bread
  (pita), as a salad, or as a party dip.
