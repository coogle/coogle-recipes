  Preheat the oven to 350 F.  Roast the chiles on an ungreased baking sheet
  until they puff up and smell toasty, about 5 minutes.
  
  Pull the chiles apart at the stem end and remove the stem (and the seeds,
  if you so desire). Place the chiles in a small bowl and cover with hot
  water, allowing them to soak for 15 to 20 minutes.
  
  Place the chiles in a blender or food processor; add a small amount of the
  soaking liquid and process to a smooth puree, adding more liquid if needed.
  The puree will keep in the refrigerator for as long as several weeks.
  
  Serving Ideas : Add to sauces for heat and a dark, almost musty flavor.
  
  Ancho chiles are dried poblanos, available in Mexican speciality stores.
