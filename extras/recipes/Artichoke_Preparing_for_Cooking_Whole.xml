      <step>  Rinse artichokes. Cut off the tip of each large leaf with a scissors, so
  you won't be pricked by the sharp tips when you're eating the leaves. Then
  with a knife, cut off the top inch or so of the artichoke. Cut off stems if
  you want; you can pare them and cook them in the pot alongside the
  artichoke.
  
  Baby artichokes, of l/2-inch diameter or less, do not need trimming.
  
  Cook immediately after trimming to avoid discoloration. Lemon may be used.
  
  After trimming artichokes wash your hands well; they tend to give your
  fingers a bitter taste and will affect the next food you pick up and eat.
