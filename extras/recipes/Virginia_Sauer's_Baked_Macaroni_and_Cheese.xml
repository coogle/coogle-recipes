        <item>save the name of each contributor (especially when the recipes</item></ing></ingredients>
    <directions>
      <step>  seem original or in some way unique) and am sharing those I've tried
  recently from names I don't see on the list anymore. I wouldn't post Mary
  Spero's because she's here and active (thank goodness!) and reposts many of
  her wonderful recipes (and all of Mary's are keepers and I save everything
  she posts).
  
  * I understand that discount warehouses (such as Sam's, or Price Club) sell
  this cheese mix separately. If this is available to you, you can substitute
  1 1/3 cups elbow macaroni and 1 1/4 ounces of the cheese mix for the
  Macaroni and Cheese Dinner Mix.
  
  ** The actual ratio of milk and sour cream doesn't really matter. I began
  adding the sour cream because I drink only skim milk, and wanted more
  richness in the macaroni. I have even made this using part plain yogurt.
  Likewise, I use whichever scraps of cheddar cheese I happen to have on
  hand. All sharp (or all extra sharp) will be fine.
  
  ~ -- Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
  
  ~ -- Pour water and salt into 3-quart saucepan. Bring to a boil.
  
  ~ -- Stir in macaroni (1 1/3 cups, which is the amount contained in the
  deluxe dinner package).
  
  ~ -- Continue boiling for 7 minutes. Turn off flame under pot.
  
  ~ -- Drain macaroni in colander. (Do not rinse.)
  
  ~ -- Pour macaroni into ungreased 1 1/2-quart ovenproof casserole.
  
  ~ -- Add butter. Stir until butter melts and coats macaroni.
  
  ~ -- Add package (1 1/4 ounces) cheese sauce mix (which is the amount
  contained in the deluxe dinner package), grated cheeses, milk, and sour
  cream. Stir until thoroughly blended. (If desired, mixture can be prepared
  up to this point, covered with clear plastic wrap, and left at room
  temperature -- or refrigerated -- until ready to bake. At that time,
  uncover and stir ingredients until well combined.)
  
  ~ -- Arrange cheese slices over top so that they cover all of the macaroni
  mixture.
  
  ~ -- Bake until golden brown (approximately 1/2 hour).
  
  Yield: 4 - 6 servings
  
  N. B. To reheat leftovers, cover casserole and bake in 325 degree oven.
  
  Although I normally eschew processed cheese, the Velveeta adds a creaminess
  which seems impossible to achieve without it.
