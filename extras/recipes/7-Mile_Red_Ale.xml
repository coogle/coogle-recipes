      <step>  Recipe by: Karl Lutzen Preparation Time: 4:00 Steep crystal malt for 30
  minutes in 150 degree water. Sparge into  brew pot of hot water and add
  malt extract. Bring to boil and add  1  ounce Fuggles. 20 minutes later add
  another ounce. At the 40 minute mark, toss in the final half ounce of
  fuggles. (Almost threw in a full ounce,  but after tasting wort, decided
  against it---plenty bitter at this  point.) Turn off heat and add Cascades.
  Stirred down the hops slowly and let sit for about 10 minutes. Strain all
  into fermenter containing  ice  water. Cooled. Pitched yeast. Single stage
  ferment. Keg, and age a few days. I came up with the name when helping
  install a phone system  and  after the job was done, I had pulled over
  seven miles of  phone  line...ugh! It's a good ale, but not the "Great Ale"
  that  I'm  still  looking for...maybe it's in the fermenter now? Original
  Gravity: 1.044 Final Gravity: 1.010 Primary Ferment: 10 days
