    <directions>
      <step>  Unwrap caramel squares and cut them in four equal parts with your kitchen
  scissors.  Set aside.  Next, snip marshmallows partway down the center,
  lengthwise.  To create a diaper, the marshmallow needs to stay in one
  piece, so make sure you don't cut all the way through.
  
  Snip two triangle-shaped wedges off the marshmallow's bottom to create leg
  openings.  Insert one piece of caramel into the cut center of each sliced
  marshmallow.
  
  With clean hands, pinch the sides of the marshmallow back together around
  the caramel piece.  Gently pinch and pull the sides of the marshmallow to
  form your diaper.
  
  Arrange the diapers on the toaster oven tray or a square of heavy-duty foil
  about 2 inches apart.  Toast on a "light toast" setting for about 30
  seconds or until marshmallows begin to bubble.  The diapers will melt and
  lose shape quickly, so be careful not to overcook.  Remove diapers from
  oven and cool slightly.  Dirty diapers taste best when they're fresh and
  warm.  Makes: 24 party poopers.
