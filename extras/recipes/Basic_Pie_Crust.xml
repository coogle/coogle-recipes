      <step>  CUT THE BUTTER into tablespoon-size pieces. Put in a food processor and
  chop by pulsing the machine on and off about 6 times. Add the egg yolk,
  water and salt and process until the ingredients are mixed, about 5
  seconds. The butter should still be in little pieces. Add the flour and
  process just until the ingredients begin to clump together. Stop processing
  before a ball forms, or even begins to form. Transfer the dough to a large
  plastic bag. Working through the bag, press the dough into a ball, then
  flatten into a disc, about 8 inches wide. If you are using the dough right
  away, it must be chilled enough to firm it before rolling. Place it in the
  refrigerator or freezer just until it is firm but not hard. The dough can
  also be refrigerated for up to 2 days or frozen. If so, let stand at room
  temperature until softened enough to roll without splitting. 15 minutes
  before baking, place the rack in the center of the oven and preheat the
  oven to 400F. Have ready the pie plate or tart pan you will be using. Roll
  the dough on a floured board to a circle about 1/8-to-1/16-inch thick. Lift
  the dough several times and brush the board with flour to keep the dough
  from sticking. Lightly fold the dough in half, then in quarters. Lift to
  the pie plate or tart pan and position it with the point in the center.
  Unfold and ease it into the bottom and sides of the pan. Do not stretch the
  dough. Leave about 3/4 inch of dough beyond the upper edge of the pan and
  trim the excess. Fold the overlap so there is a double thickness of dough
  around the sides. Crimp the edge to make a decorative border. Prick the
  dough with a fork at random, so steam can escape. Refrigerate or freeze
  briefly, to firm the dough. For a pre-baked shell, line the pastry with
  aluminum foil and fill the foil with dried beans or rice to weight the
  pastry. Place on a baking sheet for easier handling. Bake for 14 minutes.
  Remove the foil with the beans or rice. (The beans or rice can be used over
  again as weights.) Prick pastry again, and bake until it is lightly
  colored, 10 to 14 minutes longer. Cool on a wire rack before filling. Sweet
  Variation: Add 2 tablespoons sugar to the work bowl with the butter.
  Decrease the salt to 1/4 teaspoon. Makes 1 Crust
