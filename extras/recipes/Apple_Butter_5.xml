      <step>  From checking my cookbooks, I would say that the difference between apple/
  pear sauce and apple/pear butter is one of degree, the latter being
  sweeter, thicker and spicier and is made by cooking down apples with apple
  juice and spices. Here's a recipe from Jean Hewitt's _The New York Times:
  The New Natural Foods Cookbook_.
  
  Combine apples and cider in a large kettle, bring to boil, and simmer,
  covered, until apples are soft. Pass through a food mill or puree in a
  blender or food processor.
  
  Combine strained applesauce with remaining ingredients in kettle. Bring to
  a boil, stirring until the sugar is dissolved.
  
  Cook gently, uncovered, until mixture becomes quite thick, at least 2 1/2
  hours, Stir often. Pour into hot sterilized jars and seal. Process in a
  boiling water bath for 15 minutes. (You could also freeze in small portions
  and store what you are currently using in the refrigerator.)
  
  Yield: about 2 quarts (8 cups is a lot of apple butter, you could cut the
  recipe down or give away as gifts.)
  
  Another suggestion: buy unsweetened apple sauce and add sugar and spices
  and cook til very thick for semi-homemade apple butter.
  
  Also, substitute ripe pears for apples or use a combination.
