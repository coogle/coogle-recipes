      <step>  Here's a recipe that goes way back in my family. I can't cite a source, but
  it's likely my father brought it back with him after he spent time in
  Korea. These are great appetizers, but we eat them as our main dish
  sometimes too. Hot and spicy, but you can reduce the seasoning for a little
  less intensity and they'll still taste good. In summer you can barbeque
  them but they're just as good in winter done in a hot frying pan over high
  heat.
  
  Cut meat across grain in very thin slices. If longer than 3 inches, cut in
  half. Place in bowl with rest of ingredients and mix well. Cover and
  refrigerate overnight (or longer for spicier flavor; must be at least 4
  hours). Place meat on rack over barbeque (high heat), one minute each side.
  Should be brown, not crusty. Or heat large fry pan, toss in meat and cook
  over high heat two minutes, stirring occasionally. Posted to TNT -
