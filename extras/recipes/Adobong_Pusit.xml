      <step>  Got down my single Filipino cook book and found this little gem.  My
  grasp of Tagalog is non-existent but I'd guess that the name
  translates as "Squid Adobo".  At any rate, it's squid stewed in
  vinegar.  I assume that the reference to "native vinegar" refers to
  nipa sap vinegar (sukang paombong). The bottle I have is a milky
  looking vinegar that tastes pretty much like any vinegar so I imagine
  that you have some latitude on what type you can use.
  
  For those of you who have never tried it, Filipino food is an
  intriguing cuisine that has elements of Southeast Asian, Chinese and
  Mexican or Spanish influences.  It has everything from spring rolls
  (lumpias) to rellenos dishes.
  
  Wash the squids very well.  Remove the long thin membrane in the head
  and slit the eyes to bring out the ink.  Place the squids in a
  saucepan with vinegar, 6 cloves garlic crushed, salt and pepper.
  Cover and cook slowly until the squids are tender.  Cut cooked squids
  into 1/2 inch slices crosswise.
  
  Crush remaining garlic and saute in a little lard in another pan. Add
  the onion and tomatoes and cook until tomatoes are very soft.  Add
  the squids and the liquid in which they were boiled.  Simmer for 7
  minutes. Season with salt, pepper and vet-sin.
