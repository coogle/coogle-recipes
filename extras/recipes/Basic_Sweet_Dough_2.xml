    <directions>
      <step>  Combine the water, yeast, and sugar in a large mixing bowl. Let stand for 2
  minutes.
  
  Add the dry milk, eggs, butter, salt, and 2 1/2 cups of the flour. Mix
  until smooth, then beat for 2 minutes. Stir in enough of the remaining
  flour to make a soft dough.
  
  Turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface (using some of the remaining
  flour) and knead for 6 to 8 minutes until smooth and elastic, adding only
  as much flour as needed to prevent the dough from sticking.
  
  Place the dough in a greased bowl; turn once to bring the greased side up.
  Cover and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in volume,
  about 1 1/2 hours.
  
  Punch down the dough and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Use this
  Basic Sweet Dough to make:
  
  Cinnamon Twist Scandinavian Almond Ring Honey Almond Twist
  
  A delicate, not-too-sweet dough that lends itself admirably to toppings and
  fillings made of fruits, nuts, and spices. It can be shaped into twists,
  rolls, rings, and braids.  Each of the accompanying recipes calls for half
  a recipe of the dough.  Double the filling if you wish to make two
  coffecakes, or make two different coffeecakes from one batch of dough.
  Either way, you can freeze one to use later.
