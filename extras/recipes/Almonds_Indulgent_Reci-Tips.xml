      <step>  If you stick to well-balanced, healthy eating on a regular basis, then
  giving into a craving when it strikes is not only permitted, but is
  encouraged. The nutritional profile of almonds allows you to incorporate
  them into a healthy diet, and their wonderful flavor and texture makes
  those decadent foods that much more special. So, with "everything in
  moderation" as your motto--indulge!
  
  Your favorite prepared cheesecake can be dressed for success by covering
  the top with toasted, slivered or chopped almonds. Simply sprinkle the
  almonds over the top of the cake to cover, and press down lightly. A
  fabulous marriage of textures and tastes!
  
  If the spirit moves you once in a while, indulge in a hot fudge sundae. Top
  it off with a generous amount of toasted slivered almonds. You can choose
  decadent fudge sauce and ice cream or go with the low fat versions. Either
  way, the crisp almonds make it a memorable treat.
  
  To make surprisingly delicious and crunchy "croutons," heat your oven to
  350 degrees, then toss 2/3 cup slivered almonds with 2 teaspoons olive oil
  in a shallow baking pan; arrange almonds in a single layer in pan and
  sprinkle with 1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese and 1/2 teaspoon garlic
  salt before baking 10 to 15 minutes until golden brown, tossing once. Cool,
  and toss the "croutons" with green salads just before serving, or sprinkle
  on steamed vegetables.
