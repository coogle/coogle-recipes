  The following appetizer is sure to be a crowd pleaser. I have never taken
  it anywhere without being asked for the recipe.
  
  Cup up pita bread into chip size triangles, separate and bake on a cookie
  sheet until crispy (approx 5 minutes).
  
  Combine all other ingredients and mash (a KitchenAid mixer works great).
  
  Bake in an uncovered casserole dish for approx 30 minutes @ 350 or until
  bubbly.
  
  Serve hot out of the oven and scoop up dip with pita bread. If you intend
  to take this to a party or are having friends over be prepared to recite
  this recipe a number of times. My wife and I bring xerox copies with us!

  NOTES: I got this recipe off the internet five years ago and have made it
  many times. I made it to take to a party this past New Year's Eve (95). It
  was originally posted by John Bilos at Bolt Beranek and Newman, Inc. in
  Cambridge, MA. What he says is true. Someone asked for the recipe again on
  New Year's Eve.
  
  I create my own adaption of the recipe by adding some green chiles. The
  last time I made it, I used about 4 poblano chiles and 3 hot New Mexican
  chiles roasted and chopped. I personally think this is a delicious
  addition!
