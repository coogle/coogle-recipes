      <step>  Soak first four ingredients together for at least 1 hour. Mix the flour in
  well, and put into a greased lined loaf tin and bake for approximately 1
  hour at 180C (GM4 375F). The cake is delicious, and served in slices with a
  little margarine on. If you wrap it in foil and keep for a few days (if it
  lasts that long) the flavour gets even better. The all-bran is available in
  the UK as Kellogg's AllBran. It's sort of little sticks of high-fibre bran
  stuff. If you can't get it in the US, I don't know what the equivalent is
  (not having been to the US myself).
