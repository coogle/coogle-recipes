      <step>  NOTE:  The first 4-Oz of semi sweet chocolate is in the block style. Also
  the chocolate chips should be semi-sweet. * The paraffin should be a 2 1/2
  X 3-inch piece that has been cut up.
  
  Combine the corn syrup and brown sugar in a 4-quart heavy Dutch oven. Cook
  over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture boils. Continue
  cooking the mixture until it reaches the hard crack stage (300 degrees F)
  on the candy thermometer, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat and
  carefully stir in the baking soda being careful as the mixture will foam
  up.  Pour the mixture at once in to a greased 13 X 9 X 2-inch baking pan.
  When cool, turn out of the pan.
  
  Break into pieces using a meat mallet or wooden spoon.  Combine the
  semi-sweet chocolate pieces and the chocolate chips, butter and paraffin
  wax in the top of a double boiler. Place over simmering water, stirring
  until melted.  Remove form the heat, but keep over the hot water. Dip the
  candy into the chocolate using a large cooking fork. Place on waxed paper
  lined baking sheets. Let stand until chocolate is set. Store the candy in a
  cool place in covered containers. If you wish, do not coat the candy with
  the chocolate Candy can be stored for several months in the freezer.
  
  Makes 3 pounds of candy.
