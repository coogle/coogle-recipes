    <directions>
      <step>  Place a pizza stone, baking tiles or an inverted baking sheet on the lowest
  rack of a cold oven; preheat for 30 minutes to 500 degrees F or the highest
  setting.
  
  For each of the artichokes, peel away and discard the tough outer leaves,
  snapping them off at the base, until you reach the pale yellow leaves with
  the darker green tops. Slice off the darkest green top and rub the
  artichoke with the cut side of the lemon half.
   With a paring knife, trim the artichoke where you snapped off the leaves,
  removing any green portions. Rub with lemon. Trim the bottom 1/4 inch off
  the stem and pare away the tough outer skin. With a melon baller or paring
  knife, remove the fuzzy choke from the center of the artichoke. Cut the
  heart into quarters, then cut each quarter into 4 pieces. Squeeze the lemon
  into a bowl of water and place the artichoke pieces into the acidulated
  water to keep them from turning brown.
  
  Heat a skillet over the medium heat, add pacetta and cook, stirring until
  golden about 4 minutes.  Drain the pancetta on paper towels. Pour off fat
  from the skillet. Add 1 1/2 tsp. of the olive oil and onions to the
  skillet.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft but not
  brown, about 3 minutes. Add the drained artichoke pieces and stir to mix
  well. Add pepper and 2/3 cup water. Cover and cook over low heat until the
  artichoke pieces are tender and most of the liquid has cooked away, about
  15 minutes.  Add leeks and stir to mix well. Taste and adjust seasonings,
  adding salt if desired. Let cool completely.
  
  Here we go with the dough again...Place dough on a lightly floured surface
  and pat into a disk.  Use a rolling pin or your hands to roll or stretch
  the dough into a circle that is 1/4 inch thick and 10 to 12 inches in
  diameter.  Transfer to a semolina or cornmeal dusted pizza peel or inverted
  baking sheet. Brush the dough with a little of the remaining olive oil.
  Distribute the artichoke mixture over the dough. Sprinkle the cheeses over
  the artichoke mixture. Drizzle with the remaining olive oil.
  
  Carefully slide the pizza onto the heated pizza stone and bake for 6 to 8
  minutes, or until the bottom is crisp and browned and the top is bubbling.
