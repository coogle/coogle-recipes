      <step>  Cook's note: You can save preparation time by using canned cannellini
  beans. Use two (15 1/2-ounce) cans. Use one can of beans whole; puree the
  beans in the other can. If you use canned beans, skip the first three steps
  of the recipe.
  
  1. Place dried beans in a large pot. Cover with cold water and allow to
  rest overnight or for 8 hours. Drain.
  
  2. Cover beans with cold water and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer,
  covered, for 40 minutes or until beans are thoroughly cooked and softened,
  but don't overcook them. Drain beans, keeping the cooking water for later
  use.
  
  3. Divide the beans in half. Leave half whole and process the other half
  until pureed in a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Set aside.
  
  4. Heat oil in a large soup pot on medium heat. Add parsley, garlic,
  celery, carrots and onions. Cook 30 minutes on low heat, stirring
  occasionally.
  
  5. Add tomatoes and stir to combine. Cook 15-25 minutes. Add the whole
  beans and the cabbage (or Swiss chard) to the soup. Add enough water to
  cover the ingredients and bring to a boil on high heat. Simmer 30 minutes.
  
  6. Add bean puree to soup. Stir to combine. Add enough boiling water to
  make the soup liquid. The exact amount of liquid will vary; you need to
  balance the amounts of liquid to the bread so that when the bread absorbs
  the liquid, the soup is very thick. Stir in bread and season with salt and
  pepper to taste. Simmer 4 minutes, or longer if you wish the bread to
  further dissolve into the soup. If you wish, stir in a little extra-virgin
  olive oil, or use it as a garnish on top of the soup after it has been
  ladled into individual bowls.
