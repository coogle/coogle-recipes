  In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar (which "feeds" the yeast) in warm tap
  water. (Water that is too hot will kill the yeast, while water that is too
  cold will not activate it.) Sprinkle the yeast over the water and stir
  gently until it dissolves, about 1 minute. When yeast is mixed with the
  water at the proper temp., a smooth, beige-colored mixture restults. (If
  the yeast clumps together and the water stays clear, discard the mixture
  and start over). Let stand in a warm spot until a thin layer of foam covers
  the surface, about 5 minutes, indicating that the yeast is effective.
  (Discard mixture and start over with a fresh package of yeast if bubbles
  have not formed within 5 mins).
  
  To mix and knead the dough by hand, combine 3 cups of the flour with the
  salt in a large mixing bowl.  Make a well in the center of the flour and
  pour in the yeast mixture and the oil. Using a wooden spoon, vigorously
  stir the flour into the well, beginning in the center and working toward
  the sides of the bowl, until the flour is incorporated and the soft dough
  just begins to hold together.
  
  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  Dust your hands with
  flour and knead the dough gently in the following manner: press down on the
  dough with the heels of your hands and push it away from you, then
  partially fold it back over itself. Shift it a quarter turn and repeat the
  procedure. While kneading, very gradually add just enough of the remaining
  1/4 cup flour until the dough is no longer sticky or tacky; this should
  take about 5 minutes. As you work, use a metal dough scraper to pry up any
  bits of dough that stick to the work surface. Continue kneading until the
  dough is smooth, elastic, and shiny, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Knead the
  dough only until it feels smooth and springy; too much kneading
  overdevelops the gluten in the flour and results in a tough crust.
  
  Shape the dough into a ball and place it in a well-oiled bowl, turning to
  coat completely on all sides with oil.  (This oiling of the dough prevents
  a hard surface from forming that would inhibit rising.) Cover the bowl
  tightly with plastic wrap to prevent moisture loss, and set to rise in a
  draft-free warm place (75 to 85 degrees F - a hotter environment may kill
  the yeast) until doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes.
  
  With your fist, punch down the dough as soon as it has doubled in bulk to
  prevent overrising.  Shape it into a ball, pressing out all the air
  bubbles.
  
  If you cannot bake pizza within 2 hours after rising, punch the dough down
  again, turn it in an oiled bowl to coat once more, cover the bowl tightly
  with plastic wrap, and refrigerate. (The dough can be punched down a total
  of 4 times and kept refrigerated up to 36 hours before the yeast is
  exhausted and the dough unusable.) Let chilled dough come to room temp.
  before proceeding.
