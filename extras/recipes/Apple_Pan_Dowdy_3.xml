      <step>  And now, for the second half - Apple Pan Dowdy. This recipe is from a book
  of Early American recipes that my mom gave me years and years ago. I have
  another called "A World Of Good Eating," that is equally as interesting and
  as old. I don't know the exact title of the book cause the front page is
  gone. I think the books were published in 1951, but am not sure. I also
  think both books were written and/or complied by Heloise Frost (of
  Heloise's Helpful Household Hints, maybe?)
  
  Mix sugar and spices together-add molasses and water. Arrange apples in a
  large baking dish and pour the mixture of molasses, etc., over them. Dot
  with butter and voer with pastry. Bake in hot oven (425) for about 30
  minutes. Then cut into the crust with a knife and return to moderate over
  (350) for at least 1 hour more. Serve with cream or ice cream. Posted to
