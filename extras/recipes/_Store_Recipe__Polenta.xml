      <step>  Recipe by: lgirardi@carbon.denver.colorado.edu (Leo J. Girardi) 1) combine
  meal, salt, and cold water.  Slowly pour into the boiling water, stirring
  constantly.  Again bring to boil, cover, reduce heat to very low and simmer
  till thick, or about eight minutes, stirring three times. 2) Pour into a
  greased 9" x 9" pan. Cool. Cover top with wax paper. refrigerate till
  thouroughly chilled. 3) Turn out on a cutting board. With a sharp, wet
  knife cut half the polenta in one-inch squares and bake, broil, or fry, as
  indicated. Refrigerate or freeze remainder for later use.
  
  My grandmother just sent me a "store recipe" for Polenta (yes good
  spelling).  This is from one of the old Italian food stores in Denver.
  Located in what, 30yrs ago, used to be the Italian section of Denver.
  Article goes on to talk about how polenta is the "spaghetti of north
  Italy", etc, etc...
  
  well, now for the way my grandfather (another Leo J. Girardi), and my
  family have always cooked it.
  
  Note: use course ground corn meal. You should be able to get it at a local
  Italian market.(I can't find it at King Soupers, Safeway, etc)
  
  Use large caste iron pot (dutch oven etc), I don't know if it will work
  with any thing else.  :-)
  
  boil water with salt added.
  
  slowly pour in, while stirring, corn meal.  Keep stirring and adding corn
  meal until thick. (note, use LARGE WOODEN spoon for stirring, known as a
  polenta stick -- This is what we were always threatened with when bad as
  children  :)
  
  once cooked and thick.  turn pan over, let cool a little.  Slice like cake
  (into wedges) server with sauce and romano cheeze.
  
  Fry leftovers, cut into cubes, with onions, garlic, potatoes, eggs, etc.
  and server for breakfast.
  
  Good luck.  It tastes great, but some people don't really understand it.
  
  Oh, sorry for no "amounts".  My grandmother and grandfather taught me to
  cood by "Thats enough" or "A little more". never used a measuring cup, etc.
