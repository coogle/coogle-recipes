      <step>  Just a few recipes from Country Living I downloaded and wanted to share.
  
  1. Heat oven to 200'F. Prepare Potato Pancakes and place on large ovenproof
  platter; keep warm in oven while preparing re- maining ingredients,
  
  2. In large skillet, heat just enough oil to thinly coat bottom of skillet
  over low heat. Add hangers, arranged in a single layer, and cook, turning
  frequently, until browned on all sides. Remove hangers to oven platter with
  Potato Pancakes. Add bacon to skillet and fry, turning frequently, until
  done. (Irish bacon does not become crispy when cooked; it has the texture
  and color of smoked ham.) Remove bacon to platter in oven. Add breakfast
  pudding rounds to skillet and cook, turning, until firm and browned on cut
  sides; remove to oven platter.
  
  3. Cut tomatoes crosswise in half; sprinkle with 1/8 t salt and 1/8 t
  pepper. Fry tomatoes, cut sides down, in skillet until lightly browned (do
  not overcook; tomatoes should retain their shape). Remove to oven platter.
  
  4. Just before serving, fry eggs, in batches, sunny-side up or as desired;
  transfer to platter and top with remaining salt and ground pepper. Garnish
  platter with fresh thyme, if desired, and serve immediately.
  
  Potato Pancakes: In 4-quart saucepan, cover 4 medium baking potatoes with
  water and heat to boiling; cover and cook potatoes 25 minutes or until
  fork-tender. Drain potatoes and cool until easy to han- dle. Peel potatoes
  and mash in bowl with 1/4 C (1/2 stick) butter. Stir in 1/2 C unsifted
  all-purpose flour, 1 large egg, 1 T chopped fresh parsley leaves, 1 T
  chopped fresh chives, 1 t salt, and 1/2 t ground black pepper; mix until
  well blended. In large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil over
  medium heat. Shape potato mixture into twelve 2 1/2-inch patties and fry,
  in batches, until golden brown on both sides, adding more oil as necessary.
  Serve immediately or keep warm until serving.
