      <step>  produce enough heat to cook the ribs thoroughly. In cold weather, prepare
  for a longer cooking time. Depending on how cold it is, when you turn ribs
  at 1 1/2 hour point you'll probably need to add an additional 15 coals to
  keep cooking temperature more or less constant. To gauge how outside
  temperatures can affect cooking times, it takes 4 hours to cook ribs in 17
  degree weather. Signs of doneness include meat starting to pull away from
  ribs (if you grab one end of an individual rib bone and twist it, the bone
  will actually turn a bit, separate from meat) and a distinct rosy glow on
  exterior.
  
  7. If there is a secret to producing authentic barbecue-joint-style ribs at
  home, it is this step: Immediately after taking ribs off grill, completely
  wrap them in aluminum foil. Put foil-wrapped ribs in a brown paper sack,
  and fold sack over ribs. Allow to rest at room temperature for 1 hour or
  more. Although it's difficult to say exactly what happens inside that
  foil-wrapped, brown-paper-sacked package, whatever it is, is good. An
  unscientific guess is that the moist, enclosed heat allows some of the
  juices to return to the meat, further flavoring and tenderizing it.
  
  8. Finally, heat up the sauce, unwrap the ribs, swab on the sauce, chop
  into individual ribs, and then chomp. Serve additional sauce passed
  separately for those who want it.

  NOTES : Allow about four hours, from start to finish.  Assemble the
  following: - A covered kettle grill. Although it doesn't have to be a "
  kettle" grill, a covered grill is a necessity for this process. . -
  Charcoal briquettes.  For purposes of consistency, all cooking was done
  over premium-quality charcoal briquettes if you prefer lump, natural
  charcoal, by all means use it, although it may affect cooking times
  slightly. - Hickory smoking chips. Hickory is absolutely the favored type
  of wood-use other types at your own risk. . - Two slabs of pork spareribs,
  about 6 pounds total (serves about 4). . - Your favorite dry rub . - Your
  favorite barbecue sauce. . - Aluminum foil (extra-wide, heavy-duty, if you
  have it on hand). - A large brown paper bag.
