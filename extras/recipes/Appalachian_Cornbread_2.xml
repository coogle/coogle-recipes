      <step>  My Granny was a mountain woman from the heart of the Appalachians. She
  cooked three huge meals a day, and she made corn bread every
  day...sometimes twice a day. I formulated this recipe from watching her
  make bread. She never measured anything, so one time I made her stop and
  let me measure what she was doing. I then cut that amount in half.
  
  She baked her cornbread in a big cast-iron skillet in a wood stove. Here's
  my adaptation of what Granny made....
  
  Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Put about 1 teaspoon bacon drippings in an 8x8
  pan, and put it into the oven to heat.
  
  In medium bowl, combine flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
  stir in remaining ingredients, beating by hand JUST until smooth. Batter
  will still be lumpy.
  
  Pour into hot, prepared pan. Bake for 18-22 minutes, or until done in
  center. Immediately remove from pan, and cool a little. Cut into nine
  squares.
