  Preheat oven at 400â‚¬. Peel and core fresh apples. Cut each into four
  wedges, then into thin slices. Sprinkle with 2/3 of cinnamon and sugar and
  mix lightly. Set aside. On a clean kitchen towel, put a single layer of
  filo dough. Brush with melted butter. Place another piece of dough on top
  and repeat until all five pieces of dough have been layered with butter.
  Place apple mixture on upper third of filo dough layers. Sprinkle with
  remaining cinnamon, sugar and roll dough, using towel to lift dough, as
  tightly as possible around apples. Place rolled dough, seam side down, on a
  buttered baking dish and brush top with remaining butter. Add a little more
  cinnamon sugar to top of roll. Bake for 30 minutes or until golden brown.
  Serve hot with whipped cream or custard sauce. You can buy filo dough in
  the freezer at your grocery store.
