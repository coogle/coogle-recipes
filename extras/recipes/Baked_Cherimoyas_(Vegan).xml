  With some trepidation, I tried cherimoya for the first time, and was
  delighted with its flavor when baked. As a raw fruit, it wasn't worth the
  novelty price paid for it.
  
  Scrub the fruit clean. Cut cherimoya horizontally in half and place fruit
  face down on an oiled pie tin. Bake 400 F until the juices begin to
  caramelize and an aroma fills your house (about 1 hour).
  
  Serve face up. The flavor is like a ginger custard. The texture is one of
  custard. The seeds are a bit of a bother, distributed throughout the fruit,
  so eat carefully. Raw, the fruit resembles an apple-pear.
