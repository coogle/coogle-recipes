      <step>  This deceptively simple cheese cream from Overscaig in Sutherland is
  delicious served as a cream pate for the first course or at the end of a
  meal as a savoury.
  
  Pound the cheese to a thick cream. Add drop by drop as much whisky as it
  will 'drink' to make a firm cream.
  
  Pack into small earthenware pots and chill in the fridge for 3 to 4 hours.
  
  Serve with hot buttered toast or oatcakes.
