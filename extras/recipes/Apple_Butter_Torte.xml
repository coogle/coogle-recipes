      <step>  When Diane wrote about my Butter Pecan Crunch reminding her of refrigerator
  cake (layers of graham crackers and pudding), that reminded me of Apple
  Butter Torte. No one can figure out exactly what this is when they taste
  it, but they love it anyway.
  
  Place two whole graham crackers side by side on a plate (long sides
  together).  Spread with a thin layer of apple butter.  Top with two more
  graham crackers.  Spread with another thin layer of apple butter.  Continue
  until you have a stack about 4" high, finishing with graham crackers.
  "Frost" with Cool Whip on all sides (except the bottom, of course! (g) ).
  Refrigerate overnight. Slice from one short end. This is beautiful and
  tasty!
