  This is another wonderful first food.  Remember: the riper the banana the
  easier on baby's digestive tract.
  
  A little mother's milk or formula
  
  Mash thoroughly and slowly mix in the milk.
  
  As baby gets older you might want to try: milk, oatmeal, wheat germ, cooked
  egg yolk or yogurt mixed in with the banana.
