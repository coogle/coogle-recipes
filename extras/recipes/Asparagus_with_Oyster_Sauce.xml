      <step>  Another recipe courtesy of John Morris, butcher and caterer in Rockhampton,
  Queensland, Australia, as discussed on ABC [Australian Broadcasting Corp.]
  Radio on Sunday 13 March 1994 in the "Queensland Sunday" programme.
  
  John opened the discussion by stating that this is NOT a Lenten meal ;-)
  (He recommended it for breakfast in bed on Sunday mornings in fact.)
  
  Allow 6 or 7 spears per person.  Not too thin and not too old.
  
  Trim bottom 1" of the asparagus spears and peel the lower part if necessary
  (shouldn't be required if you've selected the bunches correctly and trimmed
  off the bottoms) then poach them gently - get about 1" of water boiling in
  a flat pan and lay the spears in it to cook for about 7 minutes (or use a
  European-style tall asparagus boiler if you must).
  
  Cut the oysters into thin strips rather than serving them as lumps.
  
  Reserve the juice from the oyster shells - should get about 2 tablespoon
  from 6 oysters. Mix this with the dry white wine and reduce over heat by
  about 2/3rds (i.e. you'll have about 1 1/2 tablespoon left).
  
  Add this liquor and about 4 tablespoon of the poaching water slowly to the
  egg yolks and whisk them over very low heat until light and frothy (note:
  do not have the liquor or the other fluid too hot when adding to the eggs -
  you don't want to curdle them).
  
  Add seasoning.  Then draw the sauce together by adding 20 gram of *cold*
  diced butter and stirring it in gently. Add the oyster strips and fold
  through.
  
  Lay the freshly cooked asparagus spears on the serving plates and pour the
  oyster sauce over them (fairly now ;-).
