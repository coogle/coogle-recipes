      <step>  Just got back from the Disney Institute again and as always, I had a
  marvelous time. You guys have got to go! I took: Imagineering!, Radio
  Drama, Outdoor Photography, Celebrations!, Boxing Aerobics, Animation
  Sampler, Romantic Dinners, Canoe Adventures and Taste of the Word: Bayou.
  
  Celebrations: Holiday Brunch: Celebrations is a class that shows you how to
  have a dining event that not only tastes good and looks good but is
  generally enjoyable. Fitting with the holiday season, we worked on a
  holiday brunch. Aside from these recipes, we learned about table
  presentation, planning and tricks to make the event memorable. We also
  created several types of food related decorations.
  
  In a large bowl combine all the ingredients. Tie 1-tablespoon batches of
  the mix in cheese cloth or muslin bags and tie with string. As decoration,
  you can tie a stick of cinnamon to the outside of the bag. One bag makes
  enough to flavor 1 quart of cider.
  
  To make mulled cider, put the bag in a pot with 1 quart of cider. Bring to
  a slow boil and simmer for 20 minutes, covered. A 1/4 cup of rum may be
  added to spice it up a bit more.
